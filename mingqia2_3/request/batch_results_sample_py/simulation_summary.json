Let me start by recalling the typical weather patterns of the Pacific Northwest. They tend to have mild, wet, and cloudy conditions, with occasional sunny days. I should make sure the temperatures are moderate, maybe around 15-20\u00b0C in the winter and a bit higher in summer. \n\nFirst, I need to decide on the time of year. Since it's a fictional city, maybe set it in spring for a mix of weather. Let's say the first day is a cloudy morning with a slight chance of rain, then the next days can vary. Highs and lows should be consistent with spring temperatures. \n\nFor each day, I need to include high and low temps, precipitation chance, conditions, sunrise and sunset times, and air quality comments. I'll need to check if the times are realistic. Pacific Northwest has early sunrises and late sunsets, so maybe around 5:30 AM to 8:30 PM. \n\nAir quality might be good in the morning but worse if there's rain or fog. Maybe mention PM2.5 levels on some days. Also, precipitation percentages should be around 20-60% for the first few days, with maybe a few days with 100% rain. \n\nWait, the user said \"likelihood of precipitation\" so I should phrase that as a percentage. Let me make sure each day has different conditions. Maybe start with a mix of cloudy, rainy, sunny, and so on. Also, the comment on air quality should tie into the weather, like \"Good\" if there's no pollution, or \"Moderate\" if there's some fog or rain. \n\nI need to ensure that each day's data is unique and realistic. Let me check the temperature ranges again. For example, first day: high 62\u00b0F, low 48\u00b0F. Then next day high 65\u00b0F, low 50\u00b0F, etc. Maybe the temperatures gradually increase in the first few days, then stabilize. \n\nSunrise and sunset times should be consistent with the season.
