        "text": " What are the guidelines for the meal plan?\nAnswer:\nThe meal plan should include a variety of gluten-free foods, each food item no more than three times per week, with balanced meals containing protein, healthy fats, and carbohydrates. Each day's meals should have different ingredients and dishes to avoid repetition. Ensure all meals are gluten-free and suitable for dietary restrictions. Provide options for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks each day. Include a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Make sure meals are easy to prepare and nutritionally balanced.\nOkay, so I need to create a 7-day gluten-free meal plan. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The user wants each day to have breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack. The key points are variety, not repeating any specific food item within the same day, and no more than three times per week. Also, each meal should be balanced with protein, healthy fats, and carbs.\n\nFirst, I should list out the main food groups: proteins (like chicken, fish, tofu), healthy fats (nuts, avocado, seeds), and carbs (quinoa, sweet potatoes, brown rice). Then, I need to ensure that each day's meals don't repeat any specific item. For example, if I use chicken for breakfast on day 1, I can't use chicken again in the same day, but maybe on day 2, it's okay as long as it's not repeated in the same day's meals.\n\nWait, the user said \"not repeating any specific food item within the same day and including it no more than three times per week.\" So each food item can appear once or twice or three times in the week, but not more than three times. So for example, if I use quinoa in breakfast on day 1, I can use it again in lunch on day 2, but not in another meal on day 3. Wait, no, the same food can be used in different meals on different days, as long as it's not repeated in the same day. So each day's meals should not have the same food item. But across the week, a food can appear up to three times.\n\nSo, for example, quinoa can be in breakfast on day 1, then in lunch on day 2, and then in dinner on day 3. That's three times. Then it can't be used again in the rest of the week.\n\nSo I need to plan each day's meals with different ingredients",

John will propose a new idea.\n- \"Rose: Analyze data and presents findings\"\n- \"John: propose new idea\"\n- \"Jane: appointed to head project\"\n- \"Tom: need more time to fix software bug\"\n\nAnswer: Rose will analyze the data and present the findings. John will propose a new idea. Jane has been appointed to head the project. Tom said he needs more time to fix the software bug.\n\nOkay, the user wants me to summarize a meeting from the bullet points provided. They mentioned converting shorthand into a first-hand account. Let me check the input again.\n\nThe input has four bullet points: Rose's task, John's task, Jane's appointment, and Tom's need for more time. The answer given in the example is straightforward, just restating each point. But the user wants a first-hand account, so maybe using more active verbs or making it sound like the person is reporting what happened.\n\nWait, the original answer uses \"will\" for Rose and John, which is correct because they are tasks to be done. Jane is \"has been appointed\" which is past tense, but in the input it's \"appointed to head project\", so maybe that's correct. Tom says \"needs more time\", which is present tense. \n\nBut the example answer uses \"said he needs\" which is correct. So maybe the answer is already correct. The user might be testing if the assistant can recognize that the answer is already correct. But the instruction says to convert shorthand into first-hand account. Maybe the original bullet points are in shorthand, like \"Rose: Analyze data and presents findings\" which is a bit awkward. The correct version should be \"Rose will analyze the data and present the findings.\" \n\nSo the answer given is accurate. The user might be confirming that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the assistant to check if the answer is correct. But since the user provided the example answer, perhaps the task is to generate the same answer. \n\nI think the answer is correct. The assistant just needs to present the four points in a clear, first-person account, which the example answer does. So the final answer is as provided.\nThe meeting concluded with the following key decisions: Jane has been officially appointed as the project leader. Tom requested additional time to resolve a software bug. Rose is tasked with analyzing the data and",
