That's definitely a positive point. But the reviewer also says it falls apart halfway, becomes tedious, and loses touch with its base elements. So those are negative points.\n\nReview 2 talks about the story of men not adapting to society under Tyler Durden, discovering masculinity, and escaping unhappy lives. That seems like a positive aspect of the plot, but it's more of a summary of the story rather than a positive point. Maybe it's just stating the premise.\n\nReview 3 says the film has a good theme, great acting, and important messages conveyed in an unorthodox way. That's positive. However, the reviewer criticizes it for failing to connect with the audience and leaving them confused. So those are negatives. They also mention it's overrated, which is another negative.\n\nReview 4 mentions fascinating visual effects and a compelling story until the second half, which is positive. But it ends badly, which is a negative.\n\nNow, compiling all the positive points: innovative story, strong script, engaging characters, intense cinematography, good theme, great acting, important messages, fascinating visual effects, compelling story until the second half. \n\nNegative points: the film falls apart halfway, becomes tedious, loses touch with base elements, overrated, fails to connect with audience, leaves in confusion, ends badly, childish and contrived, rage against the machine vibe takes over, and people attach more importance than it deserves. \n\nI need to make sure I don't miss any points from each review and that I categorize them correctly.

        "prompt": "Instruction: You are given some reviews for a movie. Each review might have mentioned some negative or positive points about the movie. Read them carefully and extract the positive and negative points mentioned in all of the reviews. Then, make a list of these points and summarize them as positive points and negative points.\nQuestion: Review 1: I'm not sure if it's just the fact that Ed Norton really grates on me in this film, but I never really bought into the idea of Fight Club being some kind of cultural phenomenon. Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?! The visual effects are fascinating and the story is compelling until the second half. Unfortunately, it doesn't end well.\nGeneration:",

Wait, but j squared is -1, so this would be $ \\frac{3(-1)}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4} $.\n\nBut that seems like a problem because the square of a complex number can be negative. But in the context of this problem, are we supposed to find the square of the impedance? Wait, the problem says \"what is the square of the impedance\". So maybe that's okay. But in the calculation above, I think I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the impedance is $ Z = 1 + j\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} $. Wait, no, earlier I had Z = 1 + j\u221a3/2. But in the problem statement, it's given that the impedance is 1 + j\u221a3. Wait, no, let me check again. The problem says: \"the impedance is 1 + j\u221a3\". Wait, but in my calculation above, I had Z = 1 + j\u221a3/2. Maybe that's where the confusion is. Let me re-express this.\n\nThe problem says: \"The impedance is 1 + j\u221a3\". Wait, so that would be Z = 1 + j\u221a3, right? Then, the square of Z would be (1 + j\u221a3)^2. Let me compute that again.\n\n(1 + j\u221a3)^2 = 1^2 + 2*1*(j\u221a3) + (j\u221a3)^2 = 1 + 2j\u221a3 + (j^2)*(3) = 1 + 2j\u221a3 - 3 = (1 - 3) + 2j\u221a3 = -2 + 2j\u221a3. So that's the square of the impedance. But the problem is asking for the square of the impedance, so maybe that's the answer? But in the initial problem, the user might have a different intention. Wait, the original question might have been in a different context. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"the impedance is 1 + j\u221a3. What is the square of the impedance?\"\n\nSo the answer would be (-2) + 2j\u221a3. But maybe they want it in a different form? For example,",
