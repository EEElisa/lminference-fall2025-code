The electron configuration of the noble gas with the highest atomic number that is before the element with atomic number 122. But wait, the element with atomic number 122 is Unbihexium, which is a synthetic element. The noble gases are in the same group as helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, radon, and then oganesson. Oganesson is the last noble gas with atomic number 118. So, the noble gas before 122 would be oganesson, but maybe the question is about the noble gas that is before the element with 122, which is Unbihexium. But I need to check the actual order.\n\nWait, the question is: \"What is the electronic configuration of the noble gas that is before the element with atomic number 122?\" So, first, the element with atomic number 122 is Unbihexium (Ubn), which is in the 7th period. The noble gas before that would be oganesson (Og), which has atomic number 118. So, the noble gas before 122 is Og (118). Therefore, the electronic configuration of Og is the same as the noble gas with Z=118.\n\nBut to write the electron configuration, we need to write it in the standard format. Let me recall the electron configuration of oganesson. Oganesson is in period 7, group 18. Its electron configuration is [Rn] 5f14 6d10 7s2 7p6. Wait, but the standard way is to write it as [Rn] 5f14 6d10 7s2 7p6. But Rn is the noble gas before that, so the full configuration would be:\n\n1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2",
