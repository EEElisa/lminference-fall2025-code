The user should be able to read the invoice and understand the details of the order. The invoice should have a professional and organized appearance.\nOkay, let me start by understanding the user's request. They need an invoice for an online order with three distinct dresses and two pairs of shoes. The invoice must include order number, billing and shipping addresses, order date, and a table with item details. Also, a subtotal is needed. The user wants it professional and clear.\n\nFirst, I need to create a structured format. The invoice should have a header with company info, order details, and customer info. Then the table with items. Each item has quantity, item code, name, price, and total. The subtotal is the sum of all items. I should make sure the prices are realistic. Maybe dresses range from $50 to $150, shoes from $40 to $80. \n\nI need to assign unique item codes for each dress and the shoes. Let's say dresses are D101, D102, D103. Shoes are SH201 and SH202, but since they are identical, maybe same code. Wait, but the user says two identical pairs, so maybe same code. But the instruction says \"two identical pairs of shoes\" so maybe they have the same code. However, in the table, they should be listed as two separate entries? Or maybe one entry with quantity 2? The user says \"quantity, item code, product name, price, and total cost\". So if two pairs are identical, maybe the code is same for both, and quantity is 2. But the user says \"three distinct dresses and two identical pairs of shoes\". So the table would have three dresses and two shoes. But since the shoes are identical, maybe they are listed as a single entry with quantity 2. But the user might expect two entries. Hmm. The instruction says \"table outlining the details of each ordered item (quantity, item code, product name, price, and total cost calculated by multiplying the quantity and price of each specific item)\". So each item in the table is an item. So if two pairs of shoes are ordered, they could be two separate entries with same code and name, but quantity 1 each. But that would make two rows. Alternatively, one row with quantity 2. The user might",

Let $F$ be the point on $BC$ such that $BF = \\frac{1}{2} BC$. Let $H$ be the intersection of $GE$ and $FD$. Let $I$ is the midpoint of $GH$. What is the ratio $ \\frac{AI}{ID} $? \n\nLet me try to work this out step by step. So, first, I need to visualize the triangle ABC. Let me sketch it mentally. Triangle ABC with centroid G. D is the midpoint of AB. E is on AC such that CE is half of AC, so that would mean E divides AC in a 1:1 ratio? Wait, if CE is half of AC, then since AC is the whole segment, then AE would be AC - CE = AC - (1/2)AC = (1/2)AC. So E is the midpoint of AC? Wait, but the problem says E is on AC such that CE = (1/2)AC. So if AC is length, say, 2 units, then CE is 1 unit, so E is the midpoint of AC. So E is midpoint of AC. Similarly, F is on BC such that BF = (1/2)BC. So BF is half of BC, so F is the midpoint of BC. So F is the midpoint of BC. Therefore, D is the midpoint of AB, E is the midpoint of AC, F is the midpoint of BC. Therefore, the lines FD and GE are being considered. Then H is the intersection of FD and GE. Then I is the midpoint of GH. Then we need to find AI/ID. \n\nWait, but if D is the midpoint of AB, E is the midpoint of AC, F is the midpoint of BC, then FD is the line connecting midpoint of BC (F) to midpoint of AB (D). So FD is a midline of the triangle. Similarly, GE is the line from centroid G to E, which is the midpoint of AC. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can assign coordinates to the triangle and compute everything algebraically. That might be a good approach. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle ABC. Let me choose coordinates such that the calculations are easy. Let me take A at (",

        "text": "Dan example of a problem. \nThe problem is as follows: \n\nThe temperature of a room is 25 degrees Celsius. The room has a window that is 1.2 meters wide and 0.8 meters high. The window is made of glass that is 4 mm thick. The glass has an emissivity of 0.8, and the room is losing heat through the window to the outside atmosphere, which is at a temperature of 5 degrees Celsius. The heat transfer coefficient for the inside of the window is 6.5 W/m\u00b2K and for the outside of the window is 25 W/m\u00b2K. The window is facing north, and the solar radiation is 600 W/m\u00b2. The solar absorptivity of the window is 0.7. What is the net heat loss through the window?\n\nTo solve this, we need to consider the heat loss through the window due to conduction, convection, and radiation. But since the problem is about heat loss through the window, we can simplify this to consider the net heat transfer through the window. \n\nThe heat transfer through the window can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ = (T_inside - T_outside) * U * A\n\nWhere:\n\n- Q is the heat loss (in Watts)\n- T_inside is the temperature inside the room (25\u00b0C)\n- T_outside is the temperature outside (5\u00b0C)\n- U is the overall heat transfer coefficient (W/m\u00b2K)\n- A is the area of the window (m\u00b2)\n\nBut to find U, we need to consider the thermal resistance of the window.\n\nThe thermal resistance R for the window is given by:\n\nR = 1/(U * A) = 1/(h_inside * A) + 1/(h_outside * A) + (t_glass / (k_glass * A))\n\nWhere:\n\n- h_inside is the heat transfer coefficient for the inside (6.5 W/m\u00b2K)\n- h_outside is the heat transfer coefficient for the outside (25 W/m\u00b2K)\n- t_glass is the thickness of the glass (0.004 m)\n- k_glass is the thermal conductivity of glass (approximately 0.84 W/mK)\n\nWait, but the problem didn't give the thermal conductivity of the glass.
