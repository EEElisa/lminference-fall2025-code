For example: \"The word \"whipsaw\" is not to the author's mind. It means a scale used for weighing. *Whipsaw is a term that means unsteady, unbalanced, or shifting between two opposing forces.\" So, in the following example, the word \"definition\" is not to the author's mind. It means the act of defining. *Definition is the act of defining. Please make sure that the asterisks are in the correct place. Also, please make sure that you keep the same style of the previous version, which is: the original text, then a line, then the explanation. Please, don't use any markdown. Also, please check that the explanation is not too long and is in the same style as the example. Also, please check that the word that is being explained is not part of the explanation. For example, if the word is \"definition\", then the explanation should not include the word \"definition\" again. Also, note that the explanation should not be in quotes, but rather a paragraph.
