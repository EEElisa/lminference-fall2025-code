How many different ways can we arrange the letters of the word \"MATH\" so that the letters M and A are not adjacent and the letters T and H are not adjacent?\n\n**Answer**\n**a.** $\\boxed{12}$\n\n**b.** $\\boxed{8}$\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n**a.** First, we find the total number of arrangements of the letters in \"MATH\". Since there are 4 distinct letters, the total number of arrangements is $4! = 24$.\n\nNext, we find the number of arrangements where M and A are adjacent. To do this, we treat \"MA\" as a single unit. This gives us 3 units to arrange: \"MA\", T, and H. These can be arranged in $3! = 6$ ways. However, \"MA\" can also be \"AM\", so we multiply by 2, resulting in $6 \\times 2 = 12$ arrangements where M and A are adjacent.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of adjacent arrangements from the total to find the number of arrangements where M and A are not adjacent: $24 - 12 = 12$.\n\n**b.** We start with the total number of arrangements, which is still $4! = 24$.\n\nNext, we find the number of arrangements where M and A are adjacent or T and H are adjacent. To do this, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. First, we find the number of arrangements where M and A are adjacent: $12$ as calculated in part a.\n\nThen, we find the number of arrangements where T and H are adjacent. Similarly, we treat \"TH\" as a single unit, giving us 3 units: M, A, and \"TH\". These can be arranged in $3! = 6$ ways, and since \"TH\" can be \"HT\", we multiply by 2, resulting in $6 \\times 2 = 12$ arrangements where T and H are adjacent.\n\nNow, we find the number of arrangements where both M and A are adjacent and T and H are adjacent. To do this, we treat both \"MA\" and \"TH\" as single units. This gives us 2 units: \"MA\" and \"TH\".",
