        "text": "CA125 is a tumor marker that is elevated in many ovarian cancers, but is not specific for any one type. It is used to determine the response to therapy and to monitor disease recurrence. However, it is not always reliable because it can be elevated in noncancerous conditions as well. Tissue sections from human tumors and other samples were analyzed with a monoclonal antibody that detects CA125.\n\nThe diagram shows the results of the immunoassay on a tissue section. The presence of CA125 is indicated by the red dots. Please identify the structure labeled A.\n\nA. Epithelial cells  \nB. Stromal cells  \nC. Lymphocytes  \nD. Fibroblasts\n\nThe correct answer is A. Epithelial cells.\n\nCA125 is a cell surface glycoprotein that is predominantly expressed by epithelial cells, especially those of the peritoneum, endometrium, and ovarian epithelium. In the context of ovarian cancer, the overexpression of CA125 is commonly seen on the surface of tumor cells, which are typically epithelial in origin. In the immunoassay diagram, the red dots indicate the presence of the CA125 antigen, which is specifically bound by the monoclonal antibody. The structure labeled A, therefore, is most likely to be epithelial cells, as they are the primary source of CA125 expression.\n\nThe other options can be ruled out based on the following reasoning:\n\n- B. Stromal cells: Stromal cells are connective tissue cells that support the epithelial cells. They are not the primary source of CA125 expression.\n- C. Lymphocytes: Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell and are not typically associated with the expression of CA125.\n- D. Fibroblasts: Fibroblasts are cells that produce collagen and other extracellular matrix components, and they are not typically associated with the expression of CA125.\n\nTherefore, the structure labeled A is epithelial cells.\nAnswer: A. Epithelial cells\n\nThe correct answer is A. Epithelial cells.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nCA125 (Cancer Antigen 125) is a glycoprotein that is primarily expressed on the surface of **epithelial cells**, particularly those of the peritoneum, endometrium, and ovarian epithelium. In the context of ovarian cancer, the overexpression of CA125 is",
