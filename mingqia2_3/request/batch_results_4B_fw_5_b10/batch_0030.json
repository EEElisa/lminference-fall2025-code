The user wants two wedding speeches, one from a groomsman and one from a bridesmaid, both for Jack and Emily. The key points are to make sure each speech is around 150 tokens, use the same names, keep the tone natural and conversational, include specific anecdotes, avoid clich\u00e9s, and have distinct perspectives.\n\nFirst, the groomsman's speech. I need to think of a specific memory that's unique. Maybe something from the wedding day or a shared experience. The example given was the traffic jam. I should make sure that the anecdote is relatable and shows their personalities. Also, highlight Jack's growth and Emily's role. The speech should be concise, so I need to keep it to a few sentences. Avoid being too sentimental, focus on the present and future.\n\nNow for the bridesmaid's speech. The example used the dance recital",
