        "text": " \n\nOkay, let's start by breaking down the user's request. They need a divorce settlement agreement between John and Jane Smith, married in 2010, with a 13-year-old child. The assets should be split equally. The agreement must include five specific details, three supporting Jane as primary custodian and two supporting John. Also, include custody, visitation, and child support terms.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure all five details are addressed. The child's age is 13, which is straightforward. For the parents' employment and income, maybe Jane is a teacher with a stable income, and John is a self-employed contractor with fluctuating income. Education levels: Jane has a bachelor's, John has a high school diploma. Future earning: Jane might have higher potential due to her career. Marital misconduct: maybe John had an affair, which would support Jane's custody.\n\nNow, selecting three for Jane: child's age (13 is old enough for structured custody), Jane's stable job (provides consistency), and marital misconduct (gives her a stronger case). For John: his self-employment (could affect reliability) and maybe his education level (lower, but maybe not as relevant). Wait, the user said two that support John. Wait, the user said three for Jane and two for John. So need to pick two factors that support John. Maybe John's future earning capacity if he gets a promotion, and maybe his education level? But that might not be as strong. Alternatively, maybe John's employment status as a self-employed person could be a point against him, but the user wants two that support him. Hmm, maybe the future earning capacity if he can increase his income, and maybe his job stability? Wait, but in the example, Jane has a stable job. So maybe John's future earning capacity is higher? Or maybe the education level is a factor. Wait, the user wants two that support John, but the example given in the answer may have different points. Let me check the example again. The example had three for Jane: child's age, Jane's stable job, and marital misconduct. Two for John: John's future earning capacity and his education level. That makes sense. So the user wants the three supporting Jane and two supporting John. \n\nNow, the child custody, visitation, and child support terms. Need to structure that. Maybe Jane is primary custodian, John has visitation every other weekend, and holidays. Child support based on",

How many numbers are there in the sum?\n\nLet me try to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the sum of all four-digit numbers formed by using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 without repeating any digits. Then, we also need to find how many numbers are there in the sum, which I think is just asking for the total number of such four-digit numbers. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the digits we can use are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Each digit can be used only once in a number. We need to form four-digit numbers. So, the question is, how many four-digit numbers can we form with these digits without repetition? Then, sum all of them.\n\nLet me first find the number of such four-digit numbers. Since we are forming four-digit numbers, the first digit can't be zero. But since the digits we are using are 1,2,3,4,5, none of which is zero, so all permutations are valid. The number of four-digit numbers would be the number of permutations of 5 digits taken 4 at a time. That is, P(5,4) = 5*4*3*2 = 120. So, there are 120 four-digit numbers. Therefore, the second part of the question, \"how many numbers are there in the sum\" is 120. But I need to confirm this. Wait, the problem says \"Find the sum of all four-digit numbers formed by using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with no repetition of digits. How many numbers are there in the sum?\" So, maybe the second part is just confirming the count, which is 120. But maybe the question is a bit different. Wait, perhaps the problem is split into two parts: first find the sum, then find the number of numbers in the sum (which is the count). So, the answer for the second part is 120. So, that's straightforward.\n\nBut the main challenge here is to compute the sum of all these numbers. Let me think about how to approach this",
