For example, if the arrangement is 1, 2, 3, 4, then the differences are 1, 1, 1, so the total sum is 3. For the arrangement 2, 1, 4, 3, the differences are 1, 3, 1, so the total sum is 5. What's the maximum total sum we can get?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum total sum of the differences between adjacent numbers in a permutation of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nWe are given four numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4. We need to arrange them in positions 1 to 4, ensuring that each number is used exactly once. Then, for each pair of adjacent positions, we calculate the absolute difference between the numbers in those positions and sum those differences.\n\nFor example, if the arrangement is 1, 2, 3, 4, the differences are:\n\n- |1 - 2| = 1\n- |2 - 3| = 1\n- |3 - 4| = 1\n\nTotal sum = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n\nAnother example: 2, 1, 4, 3\n- |2 - 1| = 1\n- |1 - 4| = 3\n- |4 - 3| = 1\n\nTotal sum = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5.\n\nOur goal is to find the arrangement that gives the **maximum** total sum.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Strategy\n\nWe need to try all possible permutations of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 and calculate the sum of absolute differences between adjacent numbers for each permutation.\n\nThere are 4! = 24 possible permutations.\n\nTo find the maximum, we can either:\n\n1. **Enumerate all permutations** and compute the sum for each.\n2. **Use a systematic approach** to find the best arrangement.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with the first approach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: List All Permutations and Compute Sums\n\nWe will list all 24 permutations of [1, 2, 3, 4], and for each, compute the sum",
