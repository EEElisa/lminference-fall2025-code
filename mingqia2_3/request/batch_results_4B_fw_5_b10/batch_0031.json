The first `if` statement checks if `d` is less than 0 and returns the corresponding message. If that condition is not met, the function proceeds to the `else` block, which handles the case where `d` is non-negative. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior for both negative and non-negative values of `d`. The code is straightforward and uses basic conditional logic to achieve the desired outcome. The function is efficient as it only performs a single check and returns immediately. There is no need for additional loops or complex logic here, making it a simple and effective solution. The code is also easy to read and understand, which is important for maintainability and collaboration. The use of clear variable names and comments (if needed) would further enhance the code's readability.\n```python\ndef check_d(d):\n    if d < 0:\n        return \"d is negative\"\n    else:\n        return \"d is non-negative\"\n\n# Test the function with a negative d\nprint(check_d(-5))  # Expected output: \"d is negative\"\n\n# Test the function with a non-negative d\nprint(check_d(10))  # Expected output: \"d is non-negative\"\n```\n\n\nThe code is correct and meets the problem's requirements. It checks the value of `d` and returns the appropriate message. The function is simple and efficient. The test cases demonstrate its behavior for both negative and non-negative values of `d`. The code is well-structured and easy to understand. There is no error in the code, and it should work as intended. The function returns the correct message based on the value of `d`. The code is also concise and uses minimal lines to achieve the required functionality. The use of a simple conditional statement is appropriate here, as there is only one condition to check. The code is also easy to modify if additional conditions are added in the future. Overall, this is a good solution to the problem.\n```python\ndef check_d(d):\n    if d < 0:\n        return \"",
