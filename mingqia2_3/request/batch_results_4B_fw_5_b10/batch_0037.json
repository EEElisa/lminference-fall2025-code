        "text": " \nOkay, so I need to create a dataset with 5 data points where Y can be accurately predicted using X1 and X2. Then build a linear regression model. Let me start by thinking about how to generate these data points. Maybe I can use a simple linear relationship between X1, X2, and Y. For example, Y could be a combination of X1 and X2 with some coefficients. Let's say Y = 2X1 + 3X2 + error. But since the problem says Y can be accurately predicted, maybe I can make the error zero. So Y = 2X1 + 3X2. That way, the model should perfectly fit the data. \n\nNow, I need to generate 5 data points. Let me choose some simple values for X1 and X2. For example, X1 could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and X2 could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then calculate Y as 2X1 + 3X2. Wait, but that would make the data points have Y values that are exactly determined by X1 and X2. Let me check that. For the first data point: X1=1, X2=1, Y=2*1 +3*1=5. Second: X1=2, X2=2, Y=4+6=10. Third: 3,3: 6+9=15. Fourth:4,4:8+12=20. Fifth:5,5:10+15=25. So the dataset would be (1,1,5), (2,2,10), (3,3,15), (4,4,20), (5,5,25). But wait, that seems like a perfect linear relationship, but maybe there's a better way to make the model fit exactly. However, in practice, if the data is perfectly linear, the regression model should have coefficients that exactly match the coefficients in the equation. Let me check that. \n\nSuppose I use linear regression to predict Y from X1 and X2. The model would be Y = aX1 + bX2. The coefficients a and b should be 2 and 3, respectively. But with the data points I generated, the regression model should exactly fit the data. Let me verify",
