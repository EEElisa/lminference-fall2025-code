Output the answer in the format of \"The answer is (X)\" at the end.\n\nQuestion: A male neonate, who was born at 36 weeks' gestation 2 hours ago in the labor and delivery unit of the hospital, now shows signs of respiratory difficulty. The mother, an 18-year-old primigravid woman, smoked one pack of cigarettes daily throughout her pregnancy. She received prenatal care during most of the pregnancy. One episode of chlamydial cervicitis was detected during the last trimester and treated with azithromycin. The neonate was born via cesarean delivery due to fetal heart rate decelerations. The amniotic fluid was stained with light particulate meconium. Apgar scores were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The patient is 50 cm (20 in; 50th percentile) long and weighs 3005 g (6 lb 10 oz; 50th percentile); head circumference is 35 cm (14 in; 50th percentile). The infant's vital signs now are temperature 36.6\u00b0C (97.8\u00b0F), pulse 150/min, and respirations 70/min. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Physical examination discloses mild subcostal and intercostal retractions. Chest x-ray shows prominent pulmonary vascular markings and fluid in the intralobar fissures. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n Options:\nA. Group B streptococcal sepsis\nB. Meconium aspiration syndrome\nC. Respiratory distress syndrome\nD. Transient tachypnea of newborn\nAnswer:",
