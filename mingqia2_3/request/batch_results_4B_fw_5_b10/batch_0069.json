        "text": "dR/dt = -k*r^2, where k is a constant.\nBut I do not know how to solve this differential equation. Can I find r(t)? I think this is a separable equation. Let me try to separate the variables. Then, dr/dt = -k*r^2. So, dr / r^2 = -k dt. Integrating both sides, I get \u222b dr / r^2 = \u222b -k dt. That gives -1/r = -k*t + C, where C is the constant of integration. Then, multiplying both sides by -1, we get 1/r = k*t - C. Then, solving for r, we get r = 1 / (k*t - C). Is this correct? Let me check by differentiating. Let me denote the constant as C for simplicity. r = 1 / (k*t - C). Then, dr/dt = -k / (k*t - C)^2. But according to the original equation, dr/dt should be -k*r^2. Let me compute -k*r^2. That would be -k*(1 / (k*t - C)^2). Which is the same as dr/dt. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the solution is r(t) = 1 / (k*t - C). But we need to find the constant C. However, we might need an initial condition. For example, if at t=0, r = r0, then substituting t=0, r0 = 1 / (-C), so C = -1/r0. Therefore, r(t) = 1 / (k*t + 1/r0). Alternatively, we can write it as r(t) = r0 / (1 + r0*k*t). That's a more simplified form. Let me check that. If C = -1/r0, then r(t) = 1 / (k*t - C) = 1 / (k*t + 1/r0) = r0 / (r0*k*t + 1). Yes, that's correct. So, the solution is r(t) = r0 / (1 + r0*k*t). Therefore, the radius as a function of time is r(t) = r0 / (1 + r0*k*t). But let me think again. The original differential equation is dr/dt = -k*r^2. So",
