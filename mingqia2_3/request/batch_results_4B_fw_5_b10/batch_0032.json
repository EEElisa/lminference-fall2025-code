        "text": "d<1.2. So, the fact that it is not a C2 manifold (or smooth) may be the issue. But how to make sense of the differentiability?\n\nIn the singular case, the differentiability is not defined, but in our case, the \"singular\" point is not really singular. Because the set {x | x1^2 + x2^2 = x3^2} is a smooth surface (a cone). However, the cone is not a smooth manifold, since the vertex is a singular point. So, in this case, we can see that the cone is a manifold with boundary? Or is it?\n\nWait, the cone is a surface. But the vertex is not a boundary point. Wait, the cone is a smooth surface except at the vertex. But the cone is not a manifold with boundary. But the cone is a non-smooth manifold, but if we consider the cone as a topological manifold (with boundary), then the vertex is a boundary point. Because the cone is a surface, but if you take the cone as a topological space, it's homeomorphic to the disk, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cone is a manifold with boundary? But I think the cone is not a manifold with boundary, because the boundary would be a single point. But if you take the cone as a topological space, then it's homeomorphic to the closed disk. So, the boundary is a single point. However, that is not a smooth manifold with boundary, because the point is not smooth.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cone is not a manifold with boundary, but a singular manifold. But in the context of manifolds with boundary, the cone is not a manifold with boundary. So, in the case of the cone, we have a non-smooth manifold, but not a manifold with boundary.\n\nBut in our problem, the set defined by x1^2 +x2^2 =x3^2 is a cone, which is a smooth surface except at the origin. But the origin is not a boundary. So, the problem is that the cone is not a smooth manifold. Therefore, the function f(x) =x1^2 +x2^2 -x3^2 is not smooth on the cone, because the cone is not a smooth manifold.\n\nBut the question is about the set {x|f(x)=0}, which is the cone. However, the cone is not a smooth manifold, so the function f(x)",
