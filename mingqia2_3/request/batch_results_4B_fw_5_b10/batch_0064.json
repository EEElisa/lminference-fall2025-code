Medical history is significant for esophageal varices secondary to alcohol-related cirrhosis and ascites treated with spironolactone. He drinks eight to ten alcoholic beverages daily. While you are obtaining additional history, the patient vomits a large volume of bright red blood and becomes difficult to arouse. Vital signs are temperature 36.0\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 12/min, and blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Following initiation of intravenous fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management?\n Options:\nA. Arrange for transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting\nB. Begin intravenous vasopressin therapy\nC. Do endotracheal intubation\nD. Do upper endoscopy\nAnswer:",

Six weeks ago, she received a kidney transplant from a living, related donor. Immediately after the operation, she received monoclonal anti-CD3 therapy. Current medications are azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone. Her temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Physical examination shows a well-healed surgical scar. Serum studies show that her urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations have tripled. A diagnosis of allograft rejection is suspected.

The file should have the title \"A Simple Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem\", and the content should be a proof of the Pythagorean Theorem using the geometric method. Make sure to use the theorem environment for the theorem statement, and the proof environment for the proof. Also, ensure that the theorem's label is correctly referenced in the proof. Additionally, the document should be in a standard LaTeX format with proper document class and margins. The content should be in English, and the proof should be concise and correct. The user should be able to compile the LaTeX code without errors. Also, ensure that the document is properly formatted with the appropriate LaTeX packages and syntax.\n\nOkay, so I need to create a LaTeX document that proves the Pythagorean Theorem using the geometric method. The user specified using amsmath, amssymb, and amsthm packages. Let me start by recalling the structure of a LaTeX document. The basic structure includes the documentclass, then the necessary packages, then the title, and the content.\n\nFirst, the document class. The user didn't specify, but a standard one is probably article. So I'll use \\documentclass{article}. Then, the packages: amsmath for math environments, amssymb for symbols, and amsthm for theorems and proofs. So the packages should be \\usepackage{amsmath}, \\usepackage{amssymb}, and \\usepackage{amsthm}.\n\nNext, the title. The title is \"A Simple Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem\". I need to put that in the document. Then, the content. The theorem statement should be in the theorem environment, and the proof in the proof environment. Also, the theorem's label needs to be referenced in the proof. So I'll have to use \\begin{theorem}... \\end{theorem}, and then in the proof, reference it with \\ref{thm:pythagoras} or something like that.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the theorem's label is correctly referenced in the proof. So the theorem should have a label. Let me make sure that in the theorem environment, I use \\label. For example, \\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:pythagoras}... \\end{theorem}. Then in the proof, I can say \"By the Pythagorean Theorem, ...\", but",
