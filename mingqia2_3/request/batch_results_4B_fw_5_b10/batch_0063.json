Output the answer in the format of \"The answer is (X)\" at the end.\n\nQuestion: A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of persistent nonproductive cough for 6 weeks. She has not had fever or weight loss. She has hypertension treated with enalapril for the past 3 months. She does not smoke. There is no history of lung disease. She weighs 54 kg (120 lb) and is 163 cm (64 in) tall. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination and an x-ray of the chest show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of this patient's cough?\n Options:\nA. Decreased plasma renin activity\nB. Decreased serum angiotensin II concentrations\nC. Increased serum angiotensin I concentrations\nD. Increased serum bradykinin concentrations\nAnswer:",

For example, for a projective plane, which is a $(2, n, m)$-design, the question is about the existence of such planes for various $n$ and $m$. However, I'm not sure about the exact terminology for this problem.\n\nWait, but the question is about the minimal $m$ such that there exists a (d, n, m)-design. So, in the case of a projective plane, which is a 2-(n, m, 1) design. So here, d=2, n is the number of points, and m is the block size. Wait, but maybe the question is more general. For example, in coding theory, maybe similar concepts come up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimal number $m$ such that a certain design exists. But I need to be precise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the minimal number $m$ such that a (d, n, m)-design exists, given d and n. For example, for a 2-(v, k, \u03bb) design, the usual parameters are v (number of points), k (block size), \u03bb (number of blocks that contain any two points). But here, the parameters are given as d (the number of points in each block), n (the number of points in total), and m (the number of blocks). But in standard design theory, maybe the question is about the minimal number of blocks m for a given d and n. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the minimal m such that there exists a set of m subsets of an n-element set, each subset having size d, such that every d-element subset of the n-element set is contained in exactly one block. Wait, that would be a (d, n, m)-design where each d-element subset is contained in exactly one block. But that seems like a d-design where the block size is d, but that seems like a trivial case.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me check the definitions again.\n\nA (v, k, \u03bb) design is a set system where v is the number of elements, k is the block size, and \u03bb is the number of blocks that contain any given pair of elements. So, a 2-design. But in the",
