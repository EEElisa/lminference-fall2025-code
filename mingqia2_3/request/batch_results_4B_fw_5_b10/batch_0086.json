        "text": " Then answer.\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to extract specific information from the given article about O.J. Simpson's case. First, I need to go through the text carefully and identify each of the required entities. \n\nStarting with the accused: The article mentions O.J. Simpson was tried for murder, so the accused is clearly O.J. Simpson.\n\nNext, the victims. The text states he was accused of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and a restaurant waiter, Ron Goldman. So both names are victims.\n\nDefense team members: The article refers to the Dream Team, including Robert Shapiro, Johnnie Cochran, and Robert Kardashian. Those are the names to list.\n\nAllegations: The defense argued reasonable doubt about DNA evidence and misconduct by the LAPD. That's the key point here.\n\nDuration of the trial: It says the trial lasted 11 months. Straightforward.\n\nVerdict: Simpson was found not guilty in the criminal trial. The civil case was a guilty verdict, but the user asked for the criminal trial verdict. Wait, the question says \"the verdict\" in general. The article mentions both the criminal and civil parts. But the first trial was criminal, and the civil was separate. The user might be referring to the criminal trial verdict here. The text says \"Simpson was found not guilty\" in the criminal part.\n\nCivil lawsuit: Yes, the families filed a civil lawsuit. The verdict there was guilty, and damages awarded were $33.5 million.\n\nSubsequent conviction: The last sentence mentions Simpson was convicted on robbery and weapons charges. So that's the subsequent conviction.\n\nNow, check if any are missing. The article doesn't mention any other defense team members beyond the three listed. The allegations are covered. The civil lawsuit is mentioned, and the damages. The subsequent conviction is there. All entities seem to be covered. I need to make sure each entity is correctly mapped. Let me list them out one by one.\nEntity Name: Accused: O.J. Simpson\nEntity Name: Victims: Nicole Brown Simpson, Ron Goldman\nEntity Name: Defense Team Members: Robert Shapiro, Johnnie Cochran, Robert Kardashian\nEntity Name: Allegations: reasonable doubt about DNA evidence, misconduct by the Los Angeles Police Department\nEntity Name: Duration of Trial: 11 months\nEntity Name: Verdict: not guilty\nEntity Name: Civil Lawsuit: Yes\nEntity Name: Damages Awarded: $33.5 million\nEntity Name:",
        "prompt": "Instruction: Please process the provided article related to the criminal case involving O.J. Simpson. From this article, identify and extract the following specific pieces of information: the accused, the victims, the members of the defense team, the allegations, the duration of the trial, the verdict, the civil lawsuit, the damages awarded, and any subsequent conviction. If any of these elements cannot be found in the article, list them as 'Missing'. Please present each entity with its corresponding extracted value in a new line, using the format: 'Entity Name: Extracted Value'.\nQuestion: Former National Football League player, actor, and broadcaster O.J. Simpson was tried for two accounts of murder in 1994. Simpson was accused of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and a restaurant waiter, Ron Goldman.\n\nSimpson was represented by a high-profile defense team, that many referred to as the Dream Team. It included famous names like Robert Shapiro, Johnnie Cochran, and Robert Kardashian.\n\nCochran was able to convince the jury that there was reasonable doubt about the DNA evidence, and he alleged misconduct by the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nThe trial lasted 11 months, and Simpson was found not guilty. Since then, it is often referred to as \u201cthe trial of the century\u201d and there have been television series, movies, and documentaries made about the trial.\n\nHowever, the families of the deceased filed a civil lawsuit against Simpson. The jury unanimously found him guilty for both deaths, and awarded the families $33.5 million for compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nMany feel the justice system prevailed 13 years later when Simpson was convicted and sentenced on robbery and weapons charges.\nGeneration:",
