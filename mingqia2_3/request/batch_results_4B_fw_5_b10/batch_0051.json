        "text": ". Make sure the eulogy is approximately 600 words.\nOkay, the user wants an appreciative eulogy divided into four sections: intro, personal stories, accomplishments, conclusion. Start with a powerful quote and end with a proverb. Introduction needs to be three sentences max. Personal stories should include a family reference. Accomplishments need five adjectives. Total around 600 words.\n\nFirst, I need a strong opening quote. Maybe something about legacy or life. \"Life is not about finding yourself, but about creating yourself.\" That sounds good. Then the intro should be concise. Mention the deceased's impact, their legacy, and a brief statement about their life. \n\nFor personal stories, I should include a family member. Maybe talk about their children or spouse. Perhaps a memory of them being a family pillar. Maybe a specific anecdote, like a time they supported the family during tough times. \n\nIn the accomplishments section, need five adjectives. Words like compassionate, resilient, visionary, humble, and inspiring. Make sure they accurately reflect the person's traits. Need to connect these adjectives to their actions or achievements.\n\nConclusion should wrap up with a proverb. Maybe something like \"As the tree is rooted in the earth, so is the heart of a good person grounded in love and service.\" That ties back to their life's work.\n\nCheck the word count. Intro is three sentences. Personal stories need a story, so maybe 150 words. Accomplishments could be 150 words. Conclusion 100 words. That adds up to around 600.\n\nWait, the user said the introduction should be no more than three sentences. So intro: 1-2 sentences. Then personal stories, maybe two paragraphs. Accomplishments as a section. Need to ensure the adjectives are spread naturally.\n\nAlso, make sure the flow is smooth. Transition between sections. Start with the quote, then intro, then stories, then accomplishments, then conclusion with the proverb. Avoid clich\u00e9s, keep it sincere and heartfelt.\n\nCheck if the family reference is included. Maybe mention their children or spouse. For example, \"He was the anchor for his family, always there to listen and support.\" That would work.\n\nFor the adjectives, need to ensure they are accurate. Maybe use words like compassionate, resilient, visionary, humble, and inspiring. These fit well in describing a person's character.\n\nNeed to make sure the eulogy is around 600 words.",
