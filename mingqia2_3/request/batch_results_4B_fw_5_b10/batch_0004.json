She also reports shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down. She has been awakened from sleep by shortness of breath. She has not had chest pain. Her pulse is 96/min and regular, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Jugular venous pressure is 15 cm H2O. Pulmonary examination shows crackles at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm and a soft S3. A grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur is heard best at the apex, radiating to the axilla. There is 2+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n Options:\nA. Measurement of serum troponin I concentration\nB. ECG\nC. Exercise stress test\nD. Echocardiography\nAnswer:",

So, it is not necessarily\ntrue that $ \\ad{A} + \\ad{B} $ is a derivation.  So, the above identity is not\ngenerally valid.  But for the case when $ \\ad{A} $ and $ \\ad{B} $ are\nderivations, then this identity is valid.  Therefore, the exponential of the\nsum is the composition of exponentials only when the sum is a derivation.  So,\nthis is a special case.  However, for the case when $ A $ and $ B $ are\nderivation operators, then we can write that the exponential of the sum is the\nproduct of the exponentials, i.e., $ \\exp( \\ad{A} + \\ad{B} ) = \\exp( \\ad{A} )\n\\exp( \\ad{B} ) $, since the sum is a derivation.  Therefore, in the case where\n$ A $ and $ B $ are derivation operators, the exponential of the sum is the\nproduct of the exponentials.

Therefore, for\noperators $ A $ and $ B $, this is true if and only if $ \\ad{A} $ and\n$ \\ad{B} $ are derivations, which is the case when $ A $ and $ B $ are\nderivation operators (i.e., when $ A $ and $ B $ satisfy the derivation\nproperty).  Therefore, the equality $ \\exp( \\ad{A} + \\ad{B} ) = \\exp( \\ad{A} )\n\\exp( \\ad{B} ) $ is valid when $ A $ and $ B $ are derivation operators.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the exponential of the sum is the product of the\nexponentials only if $ A $ and $ B $ are derivation operators.\n",
