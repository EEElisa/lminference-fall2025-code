Make sure the flow chart has at least 6 stages. \n\nAlso,  the explanation for each stage should be concise, and the overall flow chart should be easy to follow and clearly define the process. \n\nMake sure the flow chart is in **English**, and the names of the stages should be in **bold**, and the explanations should be in **regular text**. \n\nPlease note that the instructions are in English, but the flow chart can be in any language. But I think the user wants the flow chart in English. Let me confirm that. \n\nOkay, the user said the instructions are in English, but the flow chart can be in any language. But since the user is asking for the flow chart in English, I'll proceed with that.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the flow chart has at least 6 stages, starting with \"Start\" and ending with \"End\". Each stage name is in bold, and the explanation is in regular text. The explanations should be concise and the flow chart should be easy to follow.\n\nLet me think of the stages of a business project. The first stage is usually the initiation or planning. Then maybe project planning, execution, monitoring, closing, and then end. Wait, that's five stages. Need at least six. Let me think again.\n\nStart, Project Initiation, Project Planning, Resource Allocation, Execution, Monitoring and Control, Closure, End. That's seven stages. But the user asked for at least six. So maybe Start, Project Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring, Closure, End. That's seven, but maybe the user is okay with that. Alternatively, maybe I can have Start, Planning, Execution, Monitoring, Evaluation, Closure, End. Still seven. Wait, the user said at least six, so six is okay.\n\nBut let me structure it properly. Let me list the stages:\n\n1. Start\n2. Project Initiation\n3. Project Planning\n4. Resource Allocation\n5. Execution\n6. Monitoring and Control\n7. Closure\n8. End\n\nBut that's eight. Maybe the user wants six. Let me check the instructions again. \"At least 6 stages\". So maybe six is acceptable. So I need to have six stages, starting with Start and ending with End. Let me think of the key stages.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\n1. Start\n2. Project Initiation",
