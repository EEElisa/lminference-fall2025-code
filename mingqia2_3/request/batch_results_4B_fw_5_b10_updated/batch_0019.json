Please make sure that the asterisk is not placed in the middle of a sentence, and that the asterisk is used only for words that are not part of the main sentence. It should be clearly visible. So please provide a few examples in different contexts. For instance, in a paragraph, or in a sentence, or in a list. The asterisk is used for words that are not part of the main sentence. For example, in a sentence, like: \"He arrived at the store, *but* he was not ready to leave.\" Here, the word \"but\" is not part of the main sentence. So, please give me several examples in different contexts. Please make sure that the asterisk is not used in the middle of a sentence, and that it is only used for words that are not part of the main sentence. \n\nAlso, please note that the asterisk should be clearly visible. So, please use a bold font, or a different color or something. But since we are writing in plain text, perhaps using a different symbol, like a bold asterisk. But the user wants to have the asterisk in the text, so maybe we can use a bold asterisk. However, in some cases, the asterisk may be part of the sentence, such as in a footnote, but in this case, the asterisk is used to indicate a non-essential word. So, the key is to make sure that the asterisk is not in the middle of a sentence. \n\nSo, the user wants to see examples where the asterisk is used to indicate a word that is not part of the main sentence, and that the asterisk is not placed in the middle of the sentence. Please provide several examples in different contexts. \n\nLet me think of some examples. For instance, in a sentence: \"She went to the park, *but* she was tired.\" Here, the word \"but\" is not part of the main sentence. \n\nAnother example: \"He bought a new car, *and* he decided to take it to the dealership.\" \n\nIn a paragraph: \"The meeting started on time, *however*, the discussion was off track.\" \n\nIn a list: \"- Item one, *and* item two.\" \n\nIn a sentence with a dependent clause: \"If it rains, *then* we will stay indoors.\" \n\nIn a sentence with a conjunction: \"We went to the restaurant, *so* we had dinner.\" \n\n",
