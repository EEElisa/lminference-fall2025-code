        "text": " method.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many ways I can arrange the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 such that no number is in its corresponding position. This sounds like a derangement problem. Let me recall what a derangement is. If I remember correctly, a derangement is a permutation where none of the objects appear in their original position. So, in this case, we want the number of derangements for 4 elements.\n\nBut the problem says to use the exhaustive method, which means I need to list all possible permutations and then count those that satisfy the condition. Since there are only 4 numbers, the total number of permutations is 4! = 24. So, if I can list all 24 permutations and then eliminate those that have any number in its original position, I can find the answer. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me list all permutations of 1, 2, 3, 4. Let me start with the first position being 1. Then the remaining numbers are 2, 3, 4. The permutations would be:\n\n1. 1, 2, 3, 4\n2. 1, 2, 4, 3\n3. 1, 3, 2, 4\n4. 1, 3, 4, 2\n5. 1, 4, 2, 3\n6. 1, 4, 3, 2\n\nNow, check which of these have any number in its original position. For example, the first one is 1,2,3,4. Each number is in its original position. So that's invalid. Similarly, the second one is 1,2,4,3. Here, 1 is in position 1, so invalid. Third one is 1,3,2,4. Again, 1 is in position 1 and 4 is in position 4. So invalid. Fourth one is 1,3,4,2. 1 is in position 1, so invalid. Fifth one is 1,4,2,3. 1 is in position 1, invalid. Sixth one is 1,4,3,2. 1 is in position 1, invalid. So all permutations starting with 1 are invalid.",
