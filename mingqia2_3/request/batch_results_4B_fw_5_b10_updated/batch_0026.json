        "text": " Then, write your response.\n\nOkay, so I need to create an invoice for an online order that includes three different dresses and two identical pairs of shoes. Let me start by recalling what an invoice typically includes. The user mentioned the order number, billing address, shipping address, order date, and a table with item details. Also, a subtotal for all items.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the order number. Maybe something like #ORD123456. Then, the billing and shipping addresses. I need to make sure they're different. Let's say the billing address is a real example, like 123 Main St, Cityville, State, ZIP. The shipping address could be a different location, maybe 456 Oak Ave, Suburb, State, ZIP.\n\nNext, the order date. I should use today's date, but since the current date isn't specified, maybe use a placeholder or a recent date, like 2023-10-15.\n\nNow, the items. Three dresses and two pairs of shoes. The dresses need to be distinct, so different item codes and names. Let me think of three different dresses: maybe a \"Elegant Evening Dress\" with item code D001, a \"Casual Day Dress\" with D002, and a \"Bohemian Maxi Dress\" with D003. Each should have a price. Let's assign prices: $89.99, $59.99, and $79.99. The quantity for each dress is 1, so the total for each would be the price.\n\nFor the shoes, two pairs. They should be identical, so same item code and price. Let's say \"Classic Heels\" with item code SH01, price $49.99. Quantity 2, so total is 2 * 49.99 = $99.98.\n\nThen, the subtotal would be the sum of all items. Let's calculate that: \n\nDresses: 89.99 + 59.99 + 79.99 = 229.97\n\nShoes: 99.98\n\nTotal: 229.97 + 99.98 = 329.95\n\nWait, but the user said \"subtotal cost for all the items combined\". So that's the sum of all items",
