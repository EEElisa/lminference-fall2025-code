So, for example, if $k=2m+1$, then the middle term is $S_m$.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the middle term of $S$ when $k$ is odd.\" So, in the case of $k$ odd, the middle term is the $\\frac{k+1}{2}$th term of the sequence $S$.\n\nBut how does this relate to the original problem? The original problem is to find the middle term of the sequence formed by the partial sums of the sequence $a_n = \\frac{(-1)^n}{\\sqrt{n}}$.\n\nSo, for example, if $k$ is odd, say $k=2m+1$, then the middle term is $S_m$ (since the sequence has $k+1$ terms, so the middle is at position $m+1$). Wait, no, if $k$ is the number of terms, then the middle term is the $\\frac{k+1}{2}$th term of the sequence $S$.\n\nWait, actually, the sequence $S$ is the sequence of partial sums. So, the first term is $S_1 = a_1$, the second term is $S_2 = a_1 + a_2$, etc. So, the sequence $S$ is $S_1, S_2, S_3, \\dots, S_k$. Therefore, if $k$ is odd, the middle term is $S_{(k+1)/2}$. So, for example, if $k=3$, then the middle term is $S_2$.\n\nBut the problem is not asking for the middle term in terms of $k$; it's asking for the expression of the middle term when $k$ is odd. So, in terms of $k$, if $k$ is odd, then the middle term is $S_{(k+1)/2}$, which is the partial sum up to $n=(k+1)/2$.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is expecting an expression in terms of $k$? Wait, the problem says \"the middle term of $S$ when $k$ is odd.\" So, if $k$ is odd, then the middle term is $S_{(k+1)/",
