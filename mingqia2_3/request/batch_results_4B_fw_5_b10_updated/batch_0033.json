        "text": "d$ is the total number of distinct states that the system can be in, and $\\omega$ is the frequency of the system (i.e., the number of states it can transition to in one time unit).\n\nThis model is a kind of deterministic finite automaton (DFA), where the transitions are determined by the current state and the input symbol. The number of states $d$ is important for the complexity of the system, and the frequency $\\omega$ determines how quickly the system can transition between states.\n\nNow, the question is about the number of possible distinct automata $M$ that can be constructed given that the number of states $d$ is fixed to 3 and the frequency $\\omega$ is fixed to 2. The answer is given as 120, but we are supposed to derive it.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the automaton. Since the system has 3 states, we can label them as $S_0$, $S_1$, and $S_2$ for simplicity. The frequency $\\omega$ is 2, which means that for each input symbol, the system can transition to one of the two next states. Wait, that seems a bit ambiguous. Let me think.\n\nActually, in a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), for each state and each input symbol, there is exactly one transition to another state. However, the problem here seems to be referring to a different model. The user mentioned that the number of states is $d$ and the frequency is $\\omega$. The frequency might refer to the number of transitions possible from each state, or the number of states the system can transition to in one time unit.\n\nAlternatively, the term \"frequency\" could be related to the number of possible transitions per state. For example, if $\\omega = 2$, then each state has two outgoing transitions, i.e., for each state, there are two possible transitions for each input symbol. Wait, but that would be for a DFA, each state has exactly one transition per input symbol. So perhaps the model is not a DFA but something else.\n\nAlternatively, the model could be a transition system where each state has a certain number of outgoing edges, which are determined by the frequency. However, the problem states that the number of states is fixed to 3 and the frequency is fixed to 2. So, perhaps the automaton has 3 states, and for each state, there are 2 possible transitions (i.e., the number of possible outgoing edges",

The purpose is to guide students through the application process, helping them understand requirements, improve their chances of acceptance, and succeed in their academic pursuits. The target audience is students who are currently or planning to apply to graduate school. The key themes of the content include application strategies, essay writing, interview preparation, financial aid, and school selection. Possible name ideas include \"GradSchoolHelper,\" \"GraduatePath,\" \"ApplySmart,\" \"GradAdvisory,\" \"GradSuccess,\" \"GradPrep,\" \"GradGuide,\" \"GradAppPro,\" and \"GradEdge.\"\nOkay, so I need to come up with some name ideas for a YouTube channel that helps students prepare for and apply to graduate schools. Let me start by understanding the main points from the question. The channel's purpose is to provide videos and content that assist students in the application process. The target audience is students who are either currently applying or planning to apply. The key themes include application strategies, essay writing, interview prep, financial aid, and school selection.\n\nFirst, I should think about keywords related to graduate school and application. Words like \"Grad,\" \"Apply,\" \"School,\" \"Admission,\" \"Prep,\" \"Guide,\" \"Path,\" \"Success,\" \"Advisory,\" \"Edge,\" \"Pro,\" \"Smart,\" \"Help,\" \"Guide,\" \"Guide,\" etc. These words can be combined in various ways. Also, considering the purpose, the names should convey support, guidance, and expertise.\n\nMaybe start with combining \"Grad\" with another word. Like \"GradSchoolHelper\" or \"GradSchoolGuide.\" But those might be too long. Alternatively, \"GradApply\" or \"GradApplyPro.\" Then think about the target audience: students, so maybe something that sounds approachable and helpful. Words like \"Smart,\" \"Pro,\" \"Edge,\" \"Guide,\" \"Path,\" \"Advisory,\" \"Success,\" \"Prep,\" \"Hub,\" \"Center.\"\n\nAlso, think about the key themes. For example, \"Essay Writing\" could be part of the name, but that might be too specific. Maybe \"EssayPrep\" or \"EssayGuide.\" But the channel covers multiple areas, so the name",
