Assignment (40% of total mark)\n\n3. Final exam (30% of total mark)\n\nTotal: 100% of total mark\n\nNotes:\n\nThis module is for students on the LLB (Environmental Law) degree. It is the first module in the degree. It is also available to students on the LLB (Law) and LLM (Environmental Law) degrees, but in that case, it is considered as a module of the first year of the degree. It is also available to students on the LLM (Environmental Law) who are not on the LLB (Environmental Law) degree. The module is also available to students on the MSc (Environmental Law and Policy) degree, but in that case, it is considered as a module of the first year of the degree. The module is also available to students on the MSc (Environmental Sciences) degree, but in that case, it is considered as a module of the second year of the degree.
