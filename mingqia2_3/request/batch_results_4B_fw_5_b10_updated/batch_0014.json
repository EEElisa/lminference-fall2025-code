The theme should be something that can be interpreted in different ways, something that could be a metaphor for something else, something that could be an allegory for a larger concept.

The stories should be written in a neutral tone, without any emotional or sentimental language.\n\nTheme: The idea of \"impermanence\" as a metaphor for change, transition, and the passage of time.\n\nOkay, so I need to create seven flash fiction stories, each with a different character, all under 50 words. The theme is \"impermanence,\" which is a metaphor for change, transition, and the passage of time. The stories should be neutral, no emotional language, focusing on actions and the world around them. Each story should subtly contribute to the unifying theme.\n\nFirst, I need to think of seven different characters with unique names. Let me brainstorm names: maybe something simple like Lira, Renn, Thorne, Mira, Kael, Sylas, and maybe a female name like Veyra. Wait, the user said at least seven, so maybe more, but seven is the minimum. Wait, the instruction says \"different characters (at least seven)\", so I need at least seven, but maybe more if needed.\n\nNow, for each character, I need to think of an action that symbolizes impermanence. Since the theme is impermanence, the stories should show something that is temporary, changing, or fleeting.\n\nLet me think of possible scenarios:\n\n1. A person who is moving. Like someone packing boxes, or leaving a place. Maybe a child leaving home.\n\n2. A natural element, like a leaf falling, or a river flowing.\n\n3. A person who is in a transient situation, like a traveler.\n\n4. A person who is creating something that will be destroyed, like a fire.\n\n5. A person who is watching something change, like a sunset.\n\n6. A person who is in a state of transition, like a season changing.\n\n7. Maybe something related to technology or modern life,",
