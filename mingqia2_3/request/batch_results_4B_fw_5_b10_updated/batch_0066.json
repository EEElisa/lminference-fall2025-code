However, in this case, the tangent line is at a distance $a$ from the center, so the distance from the point to the tangent line would be... Hmm, maybe I need to think again.\n\nWait, the tangent line is at distance $r$ from the center. But the point is outside the circle, so the distance from the point to the tangent line can be found using the formula for the distance from a point to a line. However, since the point is outside the circle, there are two tangent lines from the point to the circle. But the problem says \"the distance from point $(-3,4)$ to the tangent line is 1\". So perhaps there is a specific tangent line for which this is true?\n\nWait, but actually, the question is: given a circle with center at the origin and radius $r$, and a point $(-3,4)$ outside the circle. There are two tangent lines from this point to the circle. The distance from the point to each of these tangent lines is 1. Wait, but the distance from the point to the tangent line would be zero if the point is on the tangent line. But the point is outside the circle, so the tangent lines pass through the point. Therefore, the distance from the point to the tangent line is zero. But this contradicts the given distance of 1. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"Given a circle with center at the origin and radius $r$, and a point $(-3,4)$, which lies outside the circle",
