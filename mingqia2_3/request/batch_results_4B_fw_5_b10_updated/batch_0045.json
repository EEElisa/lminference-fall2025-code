        "text": "g (x) = 1, and the function is defined on the domain [0, 3]. The graph of the function g (x) is a line segment from (0, 1) to (3, 1). \n\nThe function h (x) is defined as the integral from 0 to x of g (t) dt. So, h (x) is the area under the curve of g (t) from 0 to x. \n\nNow, since g (t) is a constant function (1), the integral from 0 to x of g (t) dt is simply the area of a rectangle with base x and height 1. Therefore, h (x) = x * 1 = x. \n\nSo, h (x) is a linear function that increases from 0 to 3. At x = 0, h (0) = 0. At x = 3, h (3) = 3. \n\nTherefore, the graph of h (x) is a straight line from (0, 0) to (3, 3). \n\nWait, but the question is about the graph of h (x). So, the graph of h (x) is a straight line starting at (0, 0) and ending at (3, 3). Therefore, the graph of h is a straight line with slope 1. \n\nBut let me check if there's something I missed. The function h (x) is the integral of g from 0 to x. Since g is 1, the integral is x. So h (x) = x, which is a straight line. \n\nAlternatively, if the integral was from a to x, but the problem says from 0 to x. So, yes, h (x) = x. Therefore, the graph is a straight line from (0, 0) to (3, 3). \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the graph of h is a straight line from (0, 0) to (3, 3). So, the graph of h is the line y = x on [0, 3]. \n\nBut the question says \"graph of h\", so maybe I need to describe it as a straight line with slope 1 starting at (0,0). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects more explanation. But based on the given information, since g is constant 1, the integral is x, so h(x) is",
