The `main` method demonstrates the usage of this function with several test cases. The function first checks if the input is negative, in which case it returns -1. Then it checks if the input is zero, returning 1 as 0 is a perfect square. For positive numbers, it computes the square root, checks if it's an integer, and returns the integer part if it is, otherwise returns 0. The code includes comments explaining each step for clarity. The test cases cover various scenarios including positive perfect squares, non-perfect squares, negative numbers, and zero. The code is structured to be efficient and handle all edge cases correctly. The function is written in a way that is easy to understand and maintain, with clear variable names and comments. The code is also written in Java, which is a common language for such problems, and the solution is straightforward and efficient. The code is written to be as concise as possible while still being clear and correct. The code is also written with the intention of being easily tested and modified, which is a good practice for code quality.\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class PerfectSquareChecker {\n    public static int isPerfectSquare(int n) {\n        // Handle the case where n is negative\n        if (n <",

        "text": "d<0$ and $d$ is not a square, then the class number is 1. \n\nBut wait, I need to check if this is correct. Let me recall. The class number of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ being 1 means that the ring of integers has unique factorization. For example, $d=5$ is a case where the class number is 1, but $d=13$ also has class number 1. Wait, but earlier I thought that for $d$ negative, the class number is 1 for some values. But the question is about $d$ positive.\n\nWait, the problem says \"for any integer $d$ with $d<0$ and $d$ is not a square, then the class number is 1.\" But that's not true. For example, take $d=-5$, which is not a square, but the class number is 2. Wait, but actually, no. Wait, the class number of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$ is 2. So that contradicts the statement. So that statement is wrong. Wait, so maybe the question has a mistake?\n\nWait, let me check again. The problem says: \"If $d < 0$ and $d$ is not a square, then the class number is 1.\" But that's not correct. For example, $d=-5$, $-3$, $-4$, etc., have class numbers greater than 1. So maybe the problem is not correctly stated?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original question is not about the class number of the ring of integers, but something else. Wait, but the user says \"the class number is 1\", so that should be the class number of the number field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$.\n\nBut the problem is that for $d < 0$, the class numbers are not all 1. For example, $d=-1$, the class number is 1. $d=-2$ has class number 1. $d=-3$ has class number 1? Wait, now I'm confused. Let me check:\n\nWait, the class numbers for imaginary quadratic fields:\n\n- $d=-1$: class number 1\n- $d=-2$: class number 1\n- $d=-3$: class number 1\n- $d=-4$: class number 1 (but $",
