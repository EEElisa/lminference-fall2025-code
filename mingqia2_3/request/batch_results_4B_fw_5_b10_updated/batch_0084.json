So, we set up the equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{3} \\pi r^3 = 128 \\pi\n$$\n\nFirst, we can divide both sides of the equation by \u03c0 to simplify:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{3} r^3 = 128\n$$\n\nThen, multiply both sides by 3/2 to solve for r^3:\n\n$$\nr^3 = 128 \\times \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\n\nCalculating the right side:\n\n128 divided by 2 is 64, and 64 multiplied by 3 is 192. So:\n\n$$\nr^3 = 192\n$$\n\nNow, to find r we take the cube root of 192. Let's see, 192 factors into 64 \u00d7 3. Since 64 is 4\u00b3, we can write:\n\n$$\nr^3 = 64 \\times 3 = 4^3 \\times 3\n$$\n\nTaking the cube root:\n\n$$\nr = \\sqrt[3]{4^3 \\times 3} = 4 \\sqrt[3]{3}\n$$\n\nSo, the radius is $4 \\sqrt[3]{3}$. \n\nBut wait, let me check my steps again to be sure. \n\nStarting from the volume of hemisphere:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{3} \\pi r^3 = 128 \\pi\n$$\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0: \n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{3} r^3 = 128\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by 3/2:\n\n$$\nr^3 = 128 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 64 \\times 3 = 192\n$$\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, cube root of 192. \n\nBut 192 can be written as 64 * 3, so cube root of 64 is 4, so cube root of 192 is",
