        "text": " Chain of thought.\nOkay, let's see. I need to create five different dance formations for 8 people on an 8x8 grid. The people are labeled A to H. The audience's position is also to be indicated. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nFirst, A is the lead and must be closer to the audience than anyone else. So in all formations, A should be in a position that's nearer to the audience. The audience's position is probably in the top-left corner, but maybe I should confirm that. Wait, the problem says to indicate the audience's position, so maybe it's in a specific spot. Maybe the grid is arranged with the audience at (1,1), and the stage is from (1,1) to (8,8), with (1,1) being closest to the audience. But I need to make sure that A is in a cell that's closer to (1,1) than others.\n\nFor the first formation: dancers except A form a line parallel to the audience. Since A is the lead, maybe the line is parallel to the audience's direction. If the audience is at (1,1), then a line parallel to the audience might be horizontal. So maybe the line is along the top row, but A is in a position closer to the audience. Wait, but the first formation requires that the other dancers form a line parallel to the audience. So perhaps the line is along the row where the audience is, or maybe a line that's horizontal. Let me think: if the audience is at the top-left, then a line parallel to the audience could be a horizontal line, so maybe the other dancers are in a row next to A.\n\nWait, the first formation: except for A, the others form a line parallel to the audience. So maybe A is in the front row, and the others are in a line behind. But how to arrange them.\n\nSecond, in the third formation, some dancers create a triangular shape. So maybe a triangle with three people, but with 8 people total. So maybe a larger triangle, but with some arranged in a triangle.\n\nAlso, each formation must be distinct, so the five grids must be different. Let me start by planning each formation step by step.\n\nFirst formation: A is closest to the audience. Let's say the audience is at (1,1). Then A could be at (1,2), so that's close. The other dancers (B to H) form a",
