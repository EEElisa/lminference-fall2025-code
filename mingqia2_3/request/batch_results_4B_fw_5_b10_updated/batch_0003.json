They need three main suggestions in a single paragraph, formal tone, no markdown. Let me start by understanding the key points.\n\nFirst, the purpose statement. It should clearly state the goal. Then three strategies. Each needs to be a sentence with examples. Let me think of possible strategies. Maybe legal frameworks to protect heritage, community-led conservation projects, and sustainable economic initiatives. \n\nFor the first strategy, establishing legal frameworks like the UNESCO Convention could work. Then, community-led projects, like cultural festivals or traditional land management. Third, sustainable economic activities like eco-tourism or sustainable agriculture. Each needs a specific example. \n\nCheck the word count. Need to make sure it's between 150-200 words. Let me structure the paragraph. Start with the purpose, then each strategy in order. Avoid contractions, keep it formal. Let me draft that and count the words. \n\nWait, the user mentioned \"three primary strategies in order of priority.\" So first, legal protections, then community-led initiatives, then economic development. Each with examples. Make sure each sentence is concise. Let me check the flow and ensure it's all in one paragraph without section headers.
