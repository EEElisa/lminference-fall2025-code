All projects are related to Python, and each project is described with a brief explanation of what it does and how it works.\n\n### 1.  **Password Generator**\nThis project is a simple password generator that creates a random password based on user input. The user can specify the length of the password and choose whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The program then generates a password with the specified parameters and displays it to the user.\n\n### 2.  **Movie Ticket Booking System**\nThis project is a movie ticket booking system that allows users to book tickets for movies. The system allows users to select a movie, choose a seat, and view a list of available seats. The system also keeps track of the bookings and displays the total cost of the booking. This project uses a simple GUI (graphical user interface) to make the booking process more user-friendly.\n\n### 3.  **Quiz Game**\nThis project is a quiz game that allows users to take a quiz on any topic. The quiz consists of multiple-choice questions, and the user must select the correct answer. After completing the quiz, the program displays the user's score and provides feedback on the correct answers. This project uses a simple text-based interface for the quiz.\n\n### 4.  **To-Do List Application**\nThis project is a to-do list application that allows users to add, remove, and view tasks. The application is built using a simple text-based interface, and the user can manage their tasks easily. The to-do list is stored in a file, so the tasks are saved even after the program is closed.\n\n### 5.  **Weather App**\nThis project is a weather app that allows users to check the weather for a specific location. The app uses an API to fetch the current weather data and displays it to the user. The user can input the location, and the app provides the current temperature, humidity, and other relevant weather information.\n\n### 6.  **Text-Based Adventure Game**\nThis project is a text-based adventure game where the player navigates through different scenarios and makes choices that affect the outcome of the game. The game is built using a simple text-based interface, and the player's choices determine the story's progression.\n\n### 7. ",
