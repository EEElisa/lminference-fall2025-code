That is, I would like to know the theoretical background of threading versus multiprocessing in Python, and how to use them in practice (like how to set up a queue and manage parallel execution).\nQuestion3: How do I use the multiprocessing module in Python to run multiple processes in parallel?\nQuestion4: How to run multiple processes in parallel using Python's multiprocessing module?\n\nI need to check if any of the questions (Question2, Question3, Question4) are duplicates of Question1.\n\nStep-by-step explanation of how to determine if the questions are duplicates:\n\n1. Read the content of each question carefully.\n2. Identify the key concepts and main points each question is asking about.\n3. Compare the main points of the questions to see if they are asking the same thing or similar things.\n4. Determine if the questions are duplicates based on the comparison.\n\nNow, let's do this step by step for the given questions.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each question is asking.\n\nQuestion1: The user is asking about the advantages of multiprocessing over threading. They know that multiprocessing avoids the GIL but want to know other advantages and whether threading can do the same.\n\nQuestion2: The user is learning about threading and multiprocessing in Python, is confused about the difference between Thread and Process objects, and how to set up a queue of jobs with a limited number of parallel processes. They find examples in the documentation hard to understand and want theoretical background and practical usage examples.\n\nQuestion3: How to use the multiprocessing module to run multiple processes in parallel.\n\nQuestion4: How to run multiple processes in parallel using the multiprocessing module.\n\nNow, comparing each of these to Question1.\n\nQuestion2 is asking about the difference between threading and multiprocessing, how to set up a queue with limited parallel processes, and wants theoretical background and practical usage. It's more about understanding the concepts and practical implementation. Question1 is about the advantages of multiprocessing over threading and whether threading can do the same.\n\nSo, the main point of Question1 is about the theoretical advantages of multiprocessing vs threading, specifically why multiprocessing is better and if threading can achieve the same.\n\nQuestion2 is more about the practical implementation and understanding the difference between the two, as well as how to manage queues and parallel execution. It's not directly about the theoretical advantages of multiprocessing over threading, but rather about the practical differences and usage.\n\nTherefore, Question1 is not a duplicate of",

I know that multiprocessing gets around the Global Interpreter Lock, but what other advantages are there, and can threading not do the same thing?\nQuestion2: I am learning how to use the threading and the multiprocessing modules in Python to run certain operations in parallel and speed up my code.\nI am finding this hard (maybe because I don't have any theoretical background about it) to understand what the difference is between a threading.Thread() object and a multiprocessing.Process() one.\nAlso, it is not entirely clear to me how to instantiate a queue of jobs and having only 4 (for example) of them running in parallel, while the other wait for resources to free before being executed.\nI find the examples in the documentation clear, but not very exhaustive; as soon as I try to complicate things a bit, I receive a lot of weird errors (like a method that can't be pickled, and so on).\nSo, when should I use the threading and multiprocessing modules?\nCan you link me to some resources that explain the concepts behind these two modules and how to use them properly for complex tasks?\nGeneration:",
