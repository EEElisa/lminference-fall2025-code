But they have no prior programming or AI experience. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, the student is in their second year. That means they have one more year of college before starting their senior year. The goal is to become an AI engineer in NLP, which is a highly technical field. The challenge here is that the student has no programming background and no AI experience. So the plan needs to address the gap between their current knowledge and the required skills for NLP.\n\nLet me think about the steps required to transition from a language major to an NLP AI engineer. The key areas would be learning programming, understanding AI concepts, getting familiar with NLP, and building projects. But how to structure this over the next 3-4 years?\n\nFirst, the student needs to start with programming. Since they have no experience, they should start with the basics. Python is the most common language in AI, so that's a good starting point. Then, they need to learn data structures, algorithms, maybe some machine learning concepts. But how to approach this step by step?\n\nNext, they need to understand NLP. That would involve learning about text processing, linguistic concepts, maybe some NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy. But they might need to start with the fundamentals of NLP, like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, etc.\n\nThen, they need to get into machine learning and deep learning. That would involve learning about neural networks, maybe using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. They might need to take online courses in machine learning, perhaps starting with Andrew Ng's courses on Coursera.\n\nAlso, building projects is important. They need to create their own projects to apply what they learn. Maybe start with small projects like sentiment analysis or text classification. Then move on to more complex tasks.\n\nBut how to structure this over 3-4 years? Let's break it down year by year.\n\nFirst",
