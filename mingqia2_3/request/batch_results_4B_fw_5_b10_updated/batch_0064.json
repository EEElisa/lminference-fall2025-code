Medical history is significant for esophageal varices secondary to alcohol-related cirrhosis and ascites treated with spironolactone. He drinks eight to ten alcoholic beverages daily. While you are obtaining additional history, the patient vomits a large volume of bright red blood and becomes difficult to arouse. Vital signs are temperature 36.0\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 12/min, and blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Following initiation of intravenous fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management?\n Options:\nA. Arrange for transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting\nB. Begin intravenous vasopressin therapy\nC. Do endotracheal intubation\nD. Do upper endoscopy\nAnswer:",

Six weeks ago, she received a kidney transplant from a living, related donor. Immediately after the operation, she received monoclonal anti-CD3 therapy. Current medications are azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone. Her temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Physical examination shows a well-healed surgical scar. Serum studies show that her urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations have tripled. A diagnosis of allograft rejection is suspected. In addition, this patient's clinical presentation is best explained by an infection with which of the following agents?\n Options:\nA. Adenovirus\nB. BK virus\nC. Epstein-Barr virus\nD.

        "text": "pi, and make sure the axes are labeled, and the plot is titled. Also, add a legend.\n\nOkay, so I need to generate a LaTeX plot of a sine function using the pgfplots package. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that pgfplots is a LaTeX package for creating plots, and it's based on TikZ. So I need to include the necessary packages in the LaTeX document.\n\nThe user wants the domain from -2\u03c0 to 2\u03c0. I should set the x-axis limits accordingly. The function is y = sin(x), so the plot should be straightforward. I need to make sure the axes are labeled, which means adding labels for the x-axis and y-axis. Also, the plot should have a title. Additionally, a legend is required, so I need to include a legend entry for the sine function.\n\nLet me recall the basic structure of a pgfplots plot. The general structure includes the \\documentclass, \\usepackage{pgfplots}, then the \\begin{document}, and within that, a \\begin{tikzpicture} or \\begin{axis} environment. Wait, actually, pgfplots has its own environment, so it's usually \\begin{axis}... \\end{axis} inside the document.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Start with the LaTeX document class, include the pgfplots package.\n2. In the document body, create an axis environment with the appropriate settings.\n3. Set the x-axis limits from -2\u03c0 to 2\u03c0.\n4. Plot the function y = sin(x).\n5. Label the axes and add a title.\n6. Add a legend.\n\nLet me check the syntax for the axis environment. The key parameters would be xlabel, ylabel, title, and the domain for the x-axis. The function can be plotted using \\addplot {sin(x)}.\n\nBut wait, in pgfplots, when you use sin(x), you need to make sure that the x-axis is in radians. Since the default is radians, that's okay. But sometimes people might have to specify, but I think it's safe here.\n\nNow, for the domain, the x-axis should be from -2\u03c0 to 2\u03c0. So in the axis environment, I can set the x-axis limits using the xticklabels or just the xmin and xmax. Wait, the domain is set via the \\addplot command's domain option, or via the axis environment's xmin and xmax",
