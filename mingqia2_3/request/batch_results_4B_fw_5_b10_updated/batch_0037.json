Please ensure that the dataset has a linear relationship between the variables.\n\nTo generate the dataset, first, create a set of 5 data points for X1 and X2. Then, for each data point, compute Y using a linear equation of the form Y = aX1 + bX2 + c, where a, b, and c are constants. The linear equation should be such that Y is determined by a linear combination of X1 and X2. Additionally, the data points should be such that the relationship between X1, X2, and Y is linear and follows the equation Y = aX1 + bX2 + c.\n\nFor instance, if we choose a = 2, b = 3, c = 4, then the equation is Y = 2X1 + 3X2 + 4. Generate 5 data points where X1 and X2 are integers between 1 and 10, and Y is computed using the equation.\n\nPlease make sure that the generated dataset has a clear and consistent linear relationship. Also, ensure that the data points are not all the same in X1 and X2 values. Additionally, please provide a brief explanation of how the dataset was generated.\n\nSure! Let's create a dataset with a clear linear relationship. First, we'll select 5 data points for X1 and X2. To ensure a clear linear relationship, we'll choose X1 and X2 values that are varied but not too extreme. Let's choose the following values for X1 and X2:\n\n(X1, X2) = (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)\n\nNow, we'll compute Y for each of these data points using the equation Y = aX1 + bX2 + c. Let's choose a = 2, b = 3, and c = 4 for the linear equation. \n\nFor each data point:\n- For (1, 1): Y = 2*1 + 3*1 + 4 = 9\n- For (2, 2): Y = 2*2 + 3*2 + 4 = 16\n- For (3, 3): Y = 2*3 + 3*3 + 4 = 23\n- For (4, 4): Y = 2*4",
