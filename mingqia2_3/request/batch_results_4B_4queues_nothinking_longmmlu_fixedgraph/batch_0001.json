Schr\u00f6dinger Equation**\n\n- Describes the time evolution of a quantum system's wave function.\n- Fundamental equation in non-relativistic quantum mechanics.\n- Formulated by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in 1926.\n- Governs how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time.\n- For a particle of mass $ m $ and energy $ E $, the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is:\n\n$$\ni\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\hat{H} \\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)\n$$\n\n- $ \\hat{H} $ is the Hamiltonian operator, representing total energy.\n- In position space, it is often written as:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\n\n- Where $ V(\\mathbf{r}) $ is the potential energy.\n\n---\n\n**2. Dirac Equation**\n\n- A relativistic wave equation formulated by Paul Dirac in 1928.\n- Accounts for special relativity and spin-1/2 particles.\n- Combines quantum mechanics with Einstein's theory of relativity.\n- Describes electrons and other fermions with spin-1/2.\n- The Dirac equation is:\n\n$$\n(i\\hbar \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - mc) \\psi = 0\n$$\n\n- $ \\gamma^\\mu $ are the gamma matrices.\n- $ \\psi $ is the four-component spinor wave function.\n- Predicts the existence of antiparticles (e.g., positron).",
