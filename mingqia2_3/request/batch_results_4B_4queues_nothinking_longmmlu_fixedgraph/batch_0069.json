Cut the beer can in half to create a base and a lid.\n2. Punch holes in the bottom of the can to allow steam to escape.\n3. Attach a metal rod or pipe to the can to serve as the piston.\n4. Place a small amount of water in the can and heat it with a flame or hot source.\n5. As the water heats, steam will build up and push the piston, creating mechanical motion.\n6. Connect the piston to a wheel or crankshaft to convert the linear motion into rotational motion.\n7. Secure all parts to ensure the engine operates safely and efficiently.",
