        "prompt": "Instruction: You are given some reviews for a movie. Each review might have mentioned some negative or positive points about the movie. Read them carefully and extract the positive and negative points mentioned in all of the reviews. Then, make a list of these points and summarize them as positive points and negative points.\nQuestion: Review 1: I'm not sure if it's just the fact that Ed Norton really grates on me in this film, but I never really bought into the idea of Fight Club being some kind of cultural phenomenon. Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?! The visual effects are fascinating and the story is compelling until the second half. Unfortunately, it doesn't end well.\nGeneration:",

Use bullet points to highlight the main benefits and provide at least one scientific study as evidence.\nQuestion: \nGeneration:\nProvide a direct, concise answer. Do not show your reasoning or thought process.\nassistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\nMeditation is a powerful tool for reducing stress and improving overall well-being. Regular practice can help individuals manage stress more effectively and enhance their mental clarity. Here are the key benefits of meditation for stress reduction:\n\n- **Reduces cortisol levels**: Meditation lowers the body\u2019s stress hormone, cortisol, which helps in managing stress more effectively.\n- **Improves focus and concentration**: By training the mind to stay present, meditation enhances mental clarity and focus.\n- **Promotes emotional balance**: It helps in regulating emotions and reducing anxiety.\n- **Enhances sleep quality**: Meditation can lead to better sleep, which in turn helps in managing stress.\n- **Increases self-awareness**: Being more aware of one\u2019s thoughts and feelings allows for better stress management.\n\nA study published in *JAMA Internal Medicine* found that mindfulness meditation programs significantly reduced symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress in participants. This research supports the effectiveness of meditation as a stress-reduction technique. Incorporating meditation into daily routine can lead to long-term benefits for mental and physical health.",
