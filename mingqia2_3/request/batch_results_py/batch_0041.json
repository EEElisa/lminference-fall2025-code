        "text": " Alright, let's tackle this Punnett square problem. So, we have two parents: one is heterozygous for both traits (AaBb) and the other is homozygous dominant for one trait (A) and heterozygous for the other (AABb). Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I understand the parents correctly. The first parent is AaBb, meaning they have one dominant and one recessive allele for both traits. The second parent is AABb. So for the first trait (A), they are homozygous dominant (AA), and for the second trait (B), they are heterozygous (Bb). Got it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the possible gametes each parent can produce. For the first parent (AaBb), since they are heterozygous for both traits, their gametes will be combinations of A and a, B and b. So the possible gametes are AB, Ab, aB, and ab. Each with equal probability, right? Because they are independent, so it's a dihybrid cross.\n\nNow the second parent is AABb. For the first trait, they are AA, so they can only contribute an A allele. For the second trait, they are Bb, so they can contribute either B or b. Therefore, their possible gametes are AB and Ab. So the second parent can only produce gametes with A and either B or b.\n\nNow, to create the Punnett square, I need to list the gametes from each parent. Let me write them out:\n\nParent 1 (AaBb) gametes: AB, Ab, aB, ab\n\nParent 2 (AABb) gametes: AB, Ab\n\nSo now, I need to cross these gametes. Let me set up the Punnett square. The rows will be the gametes from Parent 2 (AB and Ab), and the columns will be the gametes from Parent 1 (AB, Ab, aB, ab). Wait, no. Actually, usually the parent's gametes are listed as rows and columns. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I should write all possible combinations. Let me try to lay it out.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think of each possible combination. Let me consider each gamete from Parent 1 and combine it with each gamete from Parent 2.\n\nSo Parent 1's gametes:",
