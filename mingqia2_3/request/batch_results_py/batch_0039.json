So each point is (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8) for some \u03b8. But the coordinates are rational numbers. So we need points on the unit circle with rational coordinates. These are called rational points on the unit circle.\n\nBut the unit circle has rational points. For example, (0,1), (1,0), (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2) but sqrt(2)/2 is irrational. Wait, so how do we get rational points?\n\nAh, yes, the rational points on the unit circle can be parametrized. For example, if we have a rational point (a,b) on the unit circle, then we can parametrize them by lines with rational slope passing through (1,0). So if we take a line with slope t, then the equation is y = t(x - 1). Substitute into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 1:\n\nx\u00b2 + t\u00b2(x - 1)^2 = 1\n\nExpanding:\n\nx\u00b2 + t\u00b2(x\u00b2 - 2x + 1) = 1\n\n(1 + t\u00b2)x\u00b2 - 2t\u00b2x + t\u00b2 - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in x. We know x=1 is a solution (since the line passes through (1,0)), so we can factor it:\n\n(x - 1)[(1 + t\u00b2)x - (t\u00b2 - 1)] = 0\n\nTherefore, the other solution is x = (t\u00b2 - 1)/(1 + t\u00b2)\n\nThen y = t(x - 1) = t[(t\u00b2 - 1)/(1 + t\u00b2) - 1] = t[ (t\u00b2 - 1 - 1 - t\u00b2)/ (1 + t\u00b2) ) ] = t[ (-2)/(1 + t\u00b2) ] = -2t/(1 + t\u00b2)\n\nTherefore, the rational points on the unit circle can be parametrized as:\n\n( (t\u00b2 - 1)/(t\u00b2 + 1), -2t/(t\u00b2 + 1) )\n\nBut since t can be any rational number, we can take t as a rational number. However, in our problem, the points A, B, C, D are distinct and lie on",
