We evaluated the effect of the magnetic field on the translocation rate in the case of two interacting particles by using a recently developed model, which accounts for the effects of the magnetic field, the electric field, and the interaction between the particles. We found that the magnetic field can have a significant effect on the translocation process, which may be used to control and optimize the translocation of multi-particle systems. The results of this study may have applications in various fields, including biological systems and nanotechnology, where the translocation of multiple particles through a membrane is a key process. However, there are still many unresolved questions, such as the precise nature of the interaction between the particles and the role of other factors like the membrane thickness and the particle size. Future research should aim to address these questions and develop more accurate models for the translocation of multiple particles in the presence of external fields. \n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\nThe authors acknowledge the support from the National Science Foundation under Grant No. XYZ-12345.
