The user wants me to generate a dataset with 5 data points in the format (X1, X2, Y), where Y can be accurately predicted using X1 and X2. Then, I need to create a linear regression model using those variables. \n\nFirst, I need to make sure that Y is a linear combination of X1 and X2. That means I should define a relationship like Y = a*X1 + b*X2 + c, where a, b, and c are constants. To keep it simple, maybe I can choose some coefficients. Let me pick a=2, b=3, and c=1. So the equation would be Y = 2X1 + 3X2 + 1. That way, if I generate X1 and X2 values, I can compute Y accurately.\n\nNow, I need to create 5 data points. Let me think of some simple numbers for X1 and X2. Maybe start with X1 values from 1 to 5 and X2 values from 2 to 6. Wait, but I need to ensure that the data points are varied enough. Let me make a table:\n\nFor example:\nData Point 1: X1=1, X2=2 \u2192 Y=2*1 + 3*2 +1 = 2 +6 +1 =9\nData Point 2: X1=2, X2=3 \u2192 Y=4 +9 +1=14\nData Point 3: X1=3, X2=4 \u2192 Y=6 +12 +1=19\nData Point 4: X1=4, X2=5 \u2192 Y=8 +15 +1=24\nData Point 5: X1=5, X2=6 \u2192 Y=10 +18 +1=29\n\nWait, but that's a perfect linear relationship. So if I use these points, the model should fit perfectly. But maybe I should introduce some noise to make it more realistic? Wait, the user said Y can be accurately predicted, so maybe it's okay to have no noise. But maybe the user wants a dataset that's linear but with some variability. However, the question says \"accurately predicted,\" which might mean that there's a perfect linear relationship. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should make the data points with some variation but still",
