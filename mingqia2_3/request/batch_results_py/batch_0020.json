The user wants a sentence that describes the plot of Star Wars, with each word starting with the last letter of the previous word. And it needs to be at least 10 words. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the main plot points of Star Wars. The story revolves around the Jedi, the Sith, the Force, the Rebellion, the Empire, Luke, Vader, Obi-Wan, Yoda, the Death Star, the planets like Tatooine, Alderaan, etc. The main conflict is between the Jedi and Sith, with the rise and fall of the Empire, the fall of Anakin, and the redemption of Luke. \n\nNow, the challenge is to create a chain where each word starts with the last letter of the previous. Let me start with a word that ends with a letter that can lead to another word. Maybe start with \"The Force awakens on Tatooine, where Luke learns from Obi-Wan, defeats Vader, and saves the galaxy.\" Wait, but that's a bit long and might not fit the chain. Let me try to build it step by step.\n\nStart with \"The Force awakens...\" Then the last letter of \"awakens\" is \"s\". So next word should start with \"s\". Maybe \"saves the galaxy\"? But \"saves\" starts with \"s\". Wait, the previous word ends with \"s\", so the next word should start with \"s\". Let me check:\n\nThe Force awakens (ends with 's') -> saves (starts with 's')... but \"saves\" is the next word. Then \"saves the galaxy\" \u2013 \"saves\" ends with 's', so next word starts with 's'. Hmm, maybe not. Let me try again.\n\nMaybe start with \"The Jedi face the Sith, who destroy the galaxy, but the Rebellion saves it.\" Wait, but the chain would be:\n\nThe (ends with 'e') -> Jedi (starts with 'J' \u2013 no, that's a problem. The first word ends with 'e', so the next word must start with 'e'. So \"The\" is first, then \"ends\" with 'e', so next word starts with 'e'. Let's try:\n\nThe Empire rises, and the Rebellion fights against the Sith. But here, the first word is \"The\" (ends with 'e'), then \"",

        "text": "5 seconds\nOkay, the user is asking about finding duplicate values in SQL. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the common methods for identifying duplicates. The typical approach is to use a GROUP BY clause along with COUNT() to find rows that appear more than once. But maybe there are different ways depending on the database system, like using window functions or subqueries.\n\nI should mention the basic method with GROUP BY and HAVING COUNT(*). Also, maybe include an example with a specific table structure. Wait, the user might not have a specific table in mind, so a general example would be better. Like, selecting columns and counting duplicates in a table called 'table_name'.\n\nAnother thing to consider is how to find the actual duplicate rows. For instance, using a subquery to get the duplicates and then selecting those rows. Also, using ROW_NUMBER() or RANK() functions to identify duplicates. That's more advanced, maybe useful for handling cases where there are multiple duplicates.\n\nI should also think about different SQL dialects. For example, MySQL vs PostgreSQL might have slight differences. But the core concepts should be similar. Maybe mention that the exact syntax might vary slightly depending on the database.\n\nWait, the user might not be familiar with all these functions. So start with the basics and then mention more advanced methods. Also, include links to relevant documentation. Let me check the official documentation for SQL standards, but since SQL is not a single standard, it's better to reference specific databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.\n\nFor example, the MySQL documentation on GROUP BY and HAVING. Or the PostgreSQL docs on window functions. Also, a general SQL tutorial might have a section on duplicates. Maybe the user is using a specific database, but since it's not specified, providing links to general resources and each major database's docs would be helpful.\n\nAnother point: sometimes people want to delete duplicates, but the question is about finding them. So focus on the 'find' part. Also, mention that the duplicate values could be in one or more columns, so the example should cover that. Maybe include a case where duplicates are in a specific column.\n\nWait, in the example, if the user wants to find duplicates in a column, they can group by that column. If they want to find duplicates in multiple columns, they need to group by all of them. So the example should include both scenarios.\n\nAlso, maybe mention using COUNT(*) vs COUNT(column_name) to handle cases where some rows",

Be sure to include at least one metaphor and one allusion to a myth, story, or historical figure.\nOkay, the user wants a fourteen-line poem in Shakespeare's style about loving life. Let me start by recalling Shakespeare's sonnet structure\u2014typically three quatrains and a couplet, iambic pentameter. Need to make sure each line follows that meter.\n\nFirst, the theme is love for life. I need to convey that passion and appreciation. Maybe start with a metaphor. How about comparing life to something vibrant? A garden? Or maybe a sunrise? Wait, the user mentioned a metaphor and an allusion. Let me think of a metaphor first. Maybe life as a blooming rose? Or a dance? \n\nThen the allusion. Which myth or historical figure? Maybe reference the Phoenix, which symbolizes rebirth. Or perhaps the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, about love and loss. Or maybe a historical figure like Daedalus? Wait, the user said at least one allusion, so maybe the Phoenix would work well with the theme of life and renewal. \n\nLet me outline the structure. First quatrain: Introduce the metaphor. Maybe \"Life's bloom doth rise, a rose in morning's light,\" that's iambic pentameter. Then the second quatrain could talk about challenges and how life persists. Third quatrain could bring in the Phoenix metaphor. Then the couplet to wrap up with the allusion and a strong conclusion. \n\nWait, the Phoenix is a myth, so that's the allusion. Let me check the lines. Need to ensure each line is 10 syllables with an unstressed-stressed pattern. Let me test the first line: \"Life's bloom doth rise, a rose in morning's light,\" that's 10 syllables. The meter: Life's BLOOM doth RISE, a ROSE in MOR-ning'S LIGHT. Yes, that's iambic pentameter. \n\nNext lines. Second quatrain: Maybe talk about hardships. \"Though tempests roar and shadows oft intrude,\" then something about overcoming. \"Yet still the heart, like spring, doth find its way,\" referencing spring as a symbol of renewal. \n\nThird quatrain: Introduce the Phoenix. \"Like Phoenix born from ashes, fierce and new,\" then maybe talk about rising again. \"It sings of life, though perishing may seem",
