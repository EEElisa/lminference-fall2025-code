        "text": " Alright, let's tackle this query. The user provided an article about O.J. Simpson's criminal case and wants specific information extracted. First, I need to identify each entity they mentioned.\n\nThe accused is clearly O.J. Simpson. The victims are Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. The defense team includes Robert Shapiro, Johnnie Cochran, and Robert Kardashian. The allegations are murder charges for both victims. The trial duration is 11 months, and the verdict was not guilty. \n\nFor the civil lawsuit, the article mentions a unanimous guilty verdict and $33.5 million in damages. However, the subsequent conviction part says Simpson was convicted on robbery and weapons charges 13 years later. Wait, the article states \"Many feel the justice system prevailed 13 years later when Simpson was convicted...\" but does it specify the charges? It says \"robbery and weapons charges,\" so that's the subsequent conviction. \n\nI need to check if all elements are present. The civil lawsuit is covered, and the subsequent conviction is mentioned. All entities are there except maybe the subsequent conviction's details. Wait, the article says \"convicted and sentenced on robbery and weapons charges,\" so that's the subsequent conviction. \n\nSo the extracted values should be:\n\nAccused: O.J. Simpson\nVictims: Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman\nDefense Team: Robert Shapiro, Johnnie Cochran, Robert Kardashian\nAllegations: murder\nTrial Duration: 11 months\nVerdict: Not guilty\nCivil Lawsuit: Yes, found guilty, $33.5 million\nSubsequent Conviction: Robbery and weapons charges\n\nWait, the user asked for \"subsequent conviction\" but the article mentions a conviction 13 years later. However, the article doesn't specify the year. The original trial was in 1995, so 13 years later would be 2008. The article says \"convicted and sentenced on robbery and weapons charges,\" so that's the subsequent conviction. \n\nI need to make sure all entities are covered. Let me go through each one again. The user also mentioned to list 'Missing' if any elements are not found. In this case, all elements are present except maybe the exact date of the subsequent conviction, but the article doesn't specify, so it's just the charges. So that's covered. \n\nI think that's all. Now, format each as per the instructions.\nOkay, let's process the article step by step. First",
        "prompt": "Instruction: Please process the provided article related to the criminal case involving O.J. Simpson. From this article, identify and extract the following specific pieces of information: the accused, the victims, the members of the defense team, the allegations, the duration of the trial, the verdict, the civil lawsuit, the damages awarded, and any subsequent conviction. If any of these elements cannot be found in the article, list them as 'Missing'. Please present each entity with its corresponding extracted value in a new line, using the format: 'Entity Name: Extracted Value'.\nQuestion: Former National Football League player, actor, and broadcaster O.J. Simpson was tried for two accounts of murder in 1994. Simpson was accused of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and a restaurant waiter, Ron Goldman.\n\nSimpson was represented by a high-profile defense team, that many referred to as the Dream Team. It included famous names like Robert Shapiro, Johnnie Cochran, and Robert Kardashian.\n\nCochran was able to convince the jury that there was reasonable doubt about the DNA evidence, and he alleged misconduct by the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nThe trial lasted 11 months, and Simpson was found not guilty. Since then, it is often referred to as \u201cthe trial of the century\u201d and there have been television series, movies, and documentaries made about the trial.\n\nHowever, the families of the deceased filed a civil lawsuit against Simpson. The jury unanimously found him guilty for both deaths, and awarded the families $33.5 million for compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nMany feel the justice system prevailed 13 years later when Simpson was convicted and sentenced on robbery and weapons charges.\nGeneration:",
