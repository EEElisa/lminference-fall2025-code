Let me verify this because the initial count of numbers not divisible by 5 or 7 can also be calculated using inclusion-exclusion. Let me check again.\n\nThe total numbers from 10 to 99: 90 numbers.\n\nNumber of numbers divisible by 5: floor(99/5) - floor(9/5) = 19 - 1 = 18.\n\nWait, wait, earlier I calculated 18 numbers divisible by 5 in 10-99. Let me check that again. The first two-digit number divisible by 5 is 10, and the last is 95. The count is (95 - 10)/5 + 1 = (85)/5 + 1 = 17 + 1 = 18. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, numbers divisible by 7: first is 14 (since 7*2=14), last is 98 (7*14=98). So count is (98 - 14)/7 + 1 = (84)/7 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 12? Wait, 14 to 98 inclusive, step 7. How many terms? Let me compute (98 - 14)/7 + 1 = 84/7 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13. So 13 numbers.\n\nThen numbers divisible by both 5 and 7, i.e., 35. Let's compute how many two-digit numbers divisible by 35. First is 35, next is 70, then 105 which is three-digit. So numbers are 35 and 70. Therefore, 2 numbers.\n\nTherefore, by inclusion-exclusion, numbers divisible by 5 or 7 are 18 + 13 - 2 = 29.\n\nTherefore, numbers not divisible by 5 or 7 are 90 - 29 = 61.

Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nOkay, so I need to arrange the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in a 2x2 grid. The conditions are that the sum of the first row equals the sum of the second row, and the sum of the first column equals the sum of the second column. Also, each number has to be used exactly once. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall that a 2x2 grid has four cells. Each number from 1 to 4 must be placed once. Let me denote the grid as follows:\n\na b\nc d\n\nSo, the first row is a and b, the second row is c and d. The columns are a and c for the first column, and b and d for the second column.\n\nThe conditions are:\n1. Sum of first row (a + b) equals sum of second row (c + d).\n2. Sum of first column (a + c) equals sum of second column (b + d).\n\nAlso, all numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 are used once. Let me think about the total sum of all numbers. The sum of numbers from 1 to 4 is 1+2+3+4=10. \n\nSince the total sum of all numbers is 10, and the sum of the first row equals the sum of the second row, then each row must sum to 10/2 = 5. Similarly, the sum of each column must also be 5 because the total sum is 10 and columns also split into two equal parts. So both rows and columns must sum to 5.\n\nTherefore, my problem reduces to arranging numbers 1-4 in a grid where each row and each column adds up to 5.\n\nSo, I need to find all possible permutations of 1,2,3,4 in the grid that satisfy these conditions.\n\nLet me think about possible row combinations. The rows have to add up to 5. Let me list all possible pairs of distinct numbers from 1-4 that add up to 5.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n1 + 4 = 5\n\n2 + ",
