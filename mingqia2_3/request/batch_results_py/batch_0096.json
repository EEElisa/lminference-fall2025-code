        "text": " Okay, I need to create a 7-day gluten-free meal plan. Let me start by recalling what gluten-free means\u2014foods that don't contain wheat, barley, rye, or their derivatives. So I have to avoid those ingredients. The user wants variety, so no repeating the same food item on the same day, and each food can't be repeated more than three times a week. Also, each day's meals should be balanced with protein, healthy fats, and carbs.\n\nFirst, I should list out possible gluten-free ingredients for each food group. For protein, sources like chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, tofu, lentils, quinoa, chia seeds, almonds, etc. Healthy fats could be avocado, olive oil, nuts, seeds, coconut oil. Carbs might include sweet potatoes, rice, oats (certified), gluten-free bread, fruits, vegetables, etc.\n\nNow, planning each day. Let me start with Day 1. Breakfast could be a smoothie with spinach, banana, almond milk, chia seeds, and a scoop of protein powder. That gives protein, healthy fats (chia, almond milk), and carbs from banana and spinach. Lunch might be a salad with grilled chicken, mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, and a vinaigrette. Dinner could be baked salmon with roasted sweet potatoes and steamed broccoli. Snack could be a handful of almonds and a piece of fruit. Wait, I need to make sure no repeats in a day. So the same food isn't used more than once. Let me check: the smoothie has banana, chia, almond milk, spinach, protein powder. The salad has chicken, mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, vinaigrette. Dinner has salmon, sweet potatoes, broccoli. Snack is almonds and fruit. No repeats in the day. That seems good.\n\nFor Day 2, maybe start with a gluten-free oatmeal with almond butter, berries, and cinnamon. That's oats (certified), almond butter (protein and healthy fats), berries (carbs and antioxidants), cinnamon (flavor). Lunch could be a quinoa bowl with black beans, corn, avocado, lime, and cilantro. That's quinoa (carbs), black beans (protein), corn (carbs), avocado (fats), lime and cilantro for flavor. Dinner might be a stir-fry with tofu, broccoli, bell peppers, and brown rice. Snack could be a Greek yogurt (gl",

        "text": "Okay, so I need to summarize a meeting based on these bullet points. The user wants shorthand converted into a first-hand account. Let me start by understanding each bullet point.\n\nFirst, Rose is supposed to analyze data and present findings. So I should mention that she's responsible for that task. Then John wants to propose a new idea. Maybe he's suggesting something innovative. Jane was appointed to head the project, so that's a leadership role. Tom says he needs more time to fix a software bug, which indicates a technical issue that's delaying progress.\n\nNow, I need to turn these into a coherent summary. Maybe start with the meeting's purpose, then each person's contribution. Use full sentences instead of bullet points. Make sure it's clear who did what. Also, check for any implicit information. For example, Tom's need for more time might affect the project timeline. Jane's appointment suggests the project is moving forward with a leader. John's idea could be a new approach. Rose's analysis is crucial for decision-making. \n\nWait, the user mentioned converting shorthand into first-hand. So instead of just listing the bullet points, I should present it as if someone was there, describing the discussion. Maybe start with \"During the meeting...\" and then each person's role. Also, ensure that the summary flows naturally, connecting the points. Let me structure it step by step: meeting topic, Rose's task, John's proposal, Jane's appointment, Tom's issue, and any implications. Need to make sure it's concise but covers all points.\nAlright, let me put it all together now.\nOkay, the user wants a summary of a meeting based on the bullet points provided. The key is to convert the shorthand into a first-hand account. Let me start by understanding each bullet point.\n\nRose is tasked with analyzing data and presenting findings. So, in the summary, I should mention that she's responsible for this task, perhaps noting that she'll be sharing her analysis. John is to propose a new idea, so I need to indicate that he's going to suggest something new. Jane has been appointed to head the project, which means she's taking on a leadership role. Tom mentions needing more time to fix a software bug, which implies a technical delay.\n\nNow, converting this into a first-hand account. I should structure it as a narrative of the meeting.
