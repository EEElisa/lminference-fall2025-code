The model takes into account the microstructural effects by introducing the nonlocal strain gradient theory, which considers the size effect of materials at different scales. The DFT method is used to calculate the energy of crystal lattice, and the energy change is used to reflect the damage evolution. The fatigue life prediction model is established based on the DFT method. The model is validated through comparison with experimental data. The results show that the model can effectively reflect the damage evolution and fatigue life of materials under low cycle fatigue (LCF) loading. The model with the nonlocal strain gradient theory presents better results than the conventional DFT-based model without considering the size effect. Moreover, the model can capture the effects of microstructural parameters, and the predicted fatigue life decreases with the increase of the nonlocal parameter and the gradient parameter. The model is expected to be used for the prediction of the fatigue life of materials at the micro scale.\nPrevious article\nin issue\nNext article\nin issue\nKeywords\nDamage mechanics\nFatigue life\nDensity functional theory\nNonlocal strain gradient model\nMicrostructure\n1. Introduction\nFatigue is one of the main causes of structural failure in engineering. The study of fatigue life prediction is of great significance for the design and safety assessment of engineering structures. However, traditional fatigue life prediction models are based on macroscopic constitutive models, which neglect the microstructural effects. As a result, they are not suitable",
