The city can be any city you choose, but it must be a real city with a distinct geographical location. The total number of words should be between 300 and 400 words, and the response should be in the form of a paragraph for each day of the forecast. The instruction should not be included in the word count. Please make sure the data is realistic and consistent with the typical weather patterns of the city. You can use any resources to find this information, such as the National Weather Service or other reliable sources, but you must not make up any data that you can't verify.\nOkay, so I need to create a 7-day weather forecast for a real city. Let me pick a city with distinct geographical features. Maybe somewhere with varied weather, like Seattle? But Seattle is usually rainy. Alternatively, maybe a city that experiences different seasons, like Chicago? Wait, the user wants at least one day with extreme heat, one with extreme cold, and one with strong winds. Let me think of a city that has all these. Maybe a coastal city with oceanic influences? Or maybe a place like Denver, Colorado? Denver has varying temperatures, maybe. Or perhaps a city in the Midwest that experiences all four seasons? Let me check. Let's go with Chicago, Illinois. It has cold winters, hot summers, and can have strong winds, especially in the spring. That might work. \n\nFirst, I need to verify typical weather patterns. Chicago has cold winters with snow, hot summers, and can have strong lake breezes. Also, during spring, there might be strong winds. So, for the forecast, I can have:\n\nDay 1: Cold, maybe a cold snap with snow, low temperatures. \nDay 2: Sunny with strong winds. \nDay 3: Extreme heat, high temps. \nDay 4: Rainy, maybe thunderstorms. \nDay 5: Cloudy, maybe a warm day. \nDay 6: Another cold day, maybe frost. \nDay 7: Partly cloudy, maybe a return to normal. \n\nWait, need to make sure that each day has high and low temps, precipitation chance, sunrise/sunset, and air quality. Also, need to check if the data is realistic. For example, extreme heat in Chicago would be around 90\u00b0F or higher. Extreme cold would be below",
