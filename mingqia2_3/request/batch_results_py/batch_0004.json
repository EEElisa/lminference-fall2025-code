She also reports shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down. She has been awakened from sleep by shortness of breath. She has not had chest pain. Her pulse is 96/min and regular, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Jugular venous pressure is 15 cm H2O. Pulmonary examination shows crackles at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm and a soft S3. A grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur is heard best at the apex, radiating to the axilla. There is 2+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n Options:\nA. Measurement of serum troponin I concentration\nB. ECG\nC. Exercise stress test\nD. Echocardiography\nAnswer:",

        "text": " \nOkay, I need to create documentation for a Python class. Let me start by choosing a class name. Maybe something like 'Calculator' since it's common and easy to understand. Now, I need at least three methods. Let me think: add, subtract, multiply, divide... but maybe more complex ones. How about a method to calculate the area of a rectangle, another for volume of a cube, and a third for checking if a number is even? Wait, that's three methods. Let me check the requirements again. Each method needs a description, input parameters with types, output types and purposes, and a sample code snippet showing each method's usage.\n\nWait, the user mentioned a minimum of three methods. Let me outline the methods. For example:\n\n1. add(a: int, b: int) -> int: Adds two numbers.\n2. subtract(a: int, b: int) -> int: Subtracts two numbers.\n3. multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int: Multiplies two numbers.\n\nBut maybe more interesting methods. Alternatively, a class that handles geometric calculations. Like a Geometry class with area, volume, and perimeter methods. Let me think. Or maybe a class that handles financial calculations, like interest, compound interest, and loan payments. Hmm. But perhaps a Calculator class is simpler for examples.\n\nLet me proceed with the Calculator class. So the class name is Calculator. Methods:\n\n- add(a, b): returns sum.\n- subtract(a, b): returns difference.\n- multiply(a, b): returns product.\n- divide(a, b): returns quotient, with possible error handling for division by zero.\n\nWait, but the user asked for three methods. So maybe three of these. Let me pick three. For example, add, subtract, and multiply. Then include a sample code showing each. But the user also wants each method to have a clear explanation, input parameters, output types, and purpose.\n\nSo for each method, the docstring should have:\n\n- Purpose: What the method does.\n- Parameters: Each parameter's name, type, and description.\n- Returns: Type and description.\n\nThen, a sample code snippet that uses each method.\n\nWait, the user wants a sample code snippet that showcases how each method is used. So maybe a code example that creates an instance of the class and calls each method with sample inputs.\n\nLet me structure the documentation. For example:\n\nclass Calculator:\n    \"\"\"A class for performing basic arithmetic operations.\"\"\"\n\n    def add(self, a",

Let me think.\n\nThe electric field E is in volts per meter (V/m), and the magnetic field B is in teslas (T). The unit of E/B is (V/m)/T. Since 1 T = 1 kg/(s\u00b2\u00b7A), and 1 V = 1 kg\u00b7m\u00b2/(s\u00b3\u00b7A), so:\n\nE/B has units of (kg\u00b7m\u00b2/(s\u00b3\u00b7A\u00b7m)) / (kg/(s\u00b2\u00b7A)) ) = (m/(s\u00b3\u00b7A)) * (s\u00b2\u00b7A/kg) * kg ) = m/s.\n\nWait, so E/B has units of velocity. That's interesting. So E/B gives velocity. Therefore, if we have E and B, then E/B is velocity, which is in m/s. Therefore, the unit of E/B is m/s.\n\nBut in the expression for the velocity of a charged particle in crossed electric and magnetic fields, the velocity is (E/B). So that's why the unit is m/s. Therefore, the units of E/B is m/s.\n\nBut in the problem, they are multiplying E and B. Wait, but the original problem says \"What is the unit of (E x B) multiplied by the unit of (E/B)\".\n\nSo first, unit of E x B. E is in V/m, B is in T. So unit of E x B is (V/m) * T. Then, multiplied by the unit of E/B, which is (V/m)/T. So overall unit is (V/m * T) * (V/m)/T. The T cancels, and we get (V^2/m^2). Wait, but V/m * T multiplied by V/m / T is (V^2/m^2). So the unit is V\u00b2/m\u00b2?\n\nBut let's check again:\n\nUnit of E x B is (V/m) * T.\n\nUnit",
