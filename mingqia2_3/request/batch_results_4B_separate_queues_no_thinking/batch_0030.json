        "text": "d panel, the panel is only drawn once when the view is first created. But if the panel is dynamically added or modified, the `drawPanel` method is not automatically called. Therefore, you need to ensure that the panel is redrawn whenever its contents change.\n\nIn the code you provided, the `drawPanel` method is called in the `onCreate` method. However, if the panel is not part of the initial layout, or if it is modified later (e.g., after a network request or user interaction), the panel may not be redrawn automatically.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo ensure the panel is redrawn whenever needed, you should:\n\n1. **Call `drawPanel` explicitly** when the panel's contents change.\n2. **Use a `Timer` or `Handler`** to periodically redraw the panel if needed.\n3. **Implement `onWindowFocusChanged`** to handle redraws when the window gains or loses focus.\n\n### Example Implementation\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to ensure the panel is redrawn correctly:\n\n```java\npublic class MyActivity extends Activity {\n    private MyPanel panel;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n\n        panel = new MyPanel(this);\n        setContentView(panel); // Ensure the panel is set as the content view\n\n        drawPanel(); // Initial draw\n    }\n\n    private void drawPanel() {\n        if (panel != null) {\n            panel.invalidate(); // Mark the panel as needing redraw\n            panel.postInvalidate(); // Force a redraw\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onWindowFocusChanged(boolean hasFocus) {\n        super.onWindowFocusChanged(hasFocus);\n        if (hasFocus) {\n            drawPanel(); // Redraw when window gains focus\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **`invalidate()`** is used to mark the panel as needing redraw, but it doesn't immediately redraw it. You need to call `postInvalidate()` to schedule the redraw.\n- **`setContentView(panel)`** ensures that the panel is the root view of the activity. If you're using a layout file, you might need to adjust that.\n- **`onWindowFocusChanged`** is useful for ensuring the panel is redrawn when the activity comes into focus, which can happen after the initial creation or when the device rotates.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- If you're dynamically modifying the panel's contents (e.g",
