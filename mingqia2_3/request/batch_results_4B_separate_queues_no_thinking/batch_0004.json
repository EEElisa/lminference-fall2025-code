She also reports shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down. She has been awakened from sleep by shortness of breath. She has not had chest pain. Her pulse is 96/min and regular, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Jugular venous pressure is 15 cm H2O. Pulmonary examination shows crackles at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm and a soft S3. A grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur is heard best at the apex, radiating to the axilla. There is 2+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n Options:\nA. Measurement of serum troponin I concentration\nB. ECG\nC. Exercise stress test\nD. Echocardiography\nAnswer:",

Let me check the conditions again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the probability that at least 1 of these conditions is met.\" So, the question is asking for the probability that either the first die is a 6, or the second die is a 6 (or both), in a single roll of two dice.\n\nBut let me confirm that the problem is correctly interpreted. The original question is: \"Suppose that two dice are rolled. What is the probability that at least one of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) the first die is a 6, (2) the second die is a 6, or (3) the first die is a 6 and the second die is a 6.\" Wait, but that seems a bit redundant. Because (1) and (2) are separate, and (3) is the intersection of (1) and (2). So, the problem is phrased as \"at least one of the following conditions is satisfied: (1), (2), or (3)\". But since (3) is already included in the union of (1) and (2), the \"or\" is redundant here. So, the problem is actually asking for the probability that the first die is a 6 or the second die is a 6, which is the same as (1) or (2). So, the third condition is redundant.\n\nBut maybe the problem is written that way to clarify that even if (3) is a separate condition, the probability is the same as the union of (1) and (2). So, the answer is the probability that either the first die is a 6, or the second die is a 6.\n\nBut maybe the problem is trying to trick us into thinking that (3) is an additional condition, but since it's already covered by the first two, the answer is just the probability of (1) or (2). So, the answer is 1 - probability that neither die is a 6. Which is 1 - (5/6 * 5/6) = 1 - 25/36 = 11/36. However, the problem as stated includes (3) as a third condition. But (3) is the intersection of (1) and (2), so if the problem is asking for the probability that at least one of (1), (2), or (3) is satisfied, then it's the same",
