So, the sum of all elements in the matrix is 9.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the sum of all elements in the matrix is 9\" and that the matrix is a 3x3 matrix with all elements 1. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem is not about the sum of all elements in the matrix, but the sum of the elements in each row. Wait, no, the problem says \"the sum of all elements in the matrix is 9\", which is 3x3 matrix with all 1s. So that's correct. But then, perhaps the problem is not about the matrix with all 1s, but the matrix is such that the sum of all elements is 9, and the matrix is 3x3. But the problem is not saying the matrix is all 1s. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"Let M be a 3x3 matrix such that the sum of all elements in M is 9.\"\n\nSo, the matrix is 3x3, and the sum of all elements is 9. So, the matrix could be any 3x3 matrix with entries that add up to 9. However, the problem says that the matrix is such that \"the sum of all elements in M is 9\", but then the actual matrix is not given. However, in the problem statement, it says \"the matrix is such that the sum of all elements is 9\" and then asks for the sum of the elements in the matrix. Wait, that seems redundant. Wait, maybe there is more to the problem? Wait, maybe I need to check the original question again.\n\nWait, the original problem is:\n\n\"Let M be a 3x3 matrix such that the sum of all elements in M is 9. What is the sum of the elements in M?\"\n\nWait, that is just a tautology. If the sum of all elements is 9, then the answer is 9. But that seems too trivial. So maybe there was a translation issue or a misstatement. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is part of a larger question, but in the current context, it's given as such. Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in",
