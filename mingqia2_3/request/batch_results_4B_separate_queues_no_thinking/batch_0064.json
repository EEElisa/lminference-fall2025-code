Medical history is significant for esophageal varices secondary to alcohol-related cirrhosis and ascites treated with spironolactone. He drinks eight to ten alcoholic beverages daily. While you are obtaining additional history, the patient vomits a large volume of bright red blood and becomes difficult to arouse. Vital signs are temperature 36.0\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 12/min, and blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Following initiation of intravenous fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management?\n Options:\nA. Arrange for transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting\nB. Begin intravenous vasopressin therapy\nC. Do endotracheal intubation\nD. Do upper endoscopy\nAnswer:",

Six weeks ago, she received a kidney transplant from a living, related donor. Immediately after the operation, she received monoclonal anti-CD3 therapy. Current medications are azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone. Her temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Physical examination shows a well-healed surgical scar. Serum studies show that her urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations have tripled. A diagnosis of allograft rejection is suspected.

        "text": "g$ is a function from the set of real numbers to the set of real numbers, and it is given that $g(x + y) + g(x - y) = 2g(x) + 2g(y)$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$. Let me try to find the form of $g$.\n\nFirst, I remember that functional equations often have solutions that are quadratic or linear. Maybe I can test some simple functions. Let me try a linear function first. Suppose $g(x) = ax + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. Let me substitute this into the equation:\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS): $g(x + y) + g(x - y) = a(x + y) + b + a(x - y) + b = a(x + y + x - y) + 2b = a(2x) + 2b = 2a x + 2b$.\n\nRight-hand side (RHS): $2g(x) + 2g(y) = 2(ax + b) + 2(ay + b) = 2ax + 2b + 2ay + 2b = 2a(x + y) + 4b$.\n\nWait, so equating LHS and RHS:\n\n2a x + 2b = 2a(x + y) + 4b.\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft: 2a x + 2b.\n\nRight: 2a x + 2a y + 4b.\n\nSubtract 2a x from both sides:\n\n2b = 2a y + 4b.\n\nRearranged: 0 = 2a y + 2b.\n\nThis must hold for all real numbers y. The only way this is possible is if 2a = 0 and 2b = 0. Therefore, a = 0 and b = 0. So the only linear solution is the zero function. But maybe there are non-linear solutions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is quadratic. Let me try a quadratic function. Let me assume that $g(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$. Let me substitute into the equation.\n\nFirst compute LHS: g(x + y) + g(x - y).\n\nCompute g(x + y):\n\na(x + y)^2 + b(x + y) + c = a(x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2",
