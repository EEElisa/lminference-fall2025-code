What is the most likely explanation for why she was not hurt?\n\nOptions:\nA. She was in the ocean.\nB. She was in a pool.\nC. She was in a river.\nD. She was in a bathtub.\n\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is about why Julie wasn't hurt when she was swept away by a large wave in the water. The options are ocean, pool, river, or bathtub.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the characteristics of each of these places. Let's start with the ocean. The ocean has large waves, especially in places like the open sea or during storms. If Julie was in the ocean and got swept by a big wave, she might be thrown around, but maybe she wasn't hurt because she was in the water and the wave didn't have enough force to harm her? Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Large waves in the ocean can be dangerous. Also, if you're swept away by a wave, you could be pulled under, but maybe she wasn't injured because she was in the ocean and the wave was just a regular wave, not a tsunami or something. But that's not the point here.\n\nThen there's a pool. Pools are usually man-made and have controlled water. They might have wave makers or water slides, but I don't think they have large waves like the ocean. Unless it's a pool with a wave machine. But if the wave was large, maybe the pool is not deep enough, so if she was swept away, she might hit the bottom and get hurt. But the question says she wasn't hurt. So maybe not a pool.\n\nRiver. Rivers can have waves, but they are usually more controlled. However, some rivers, especially rapids, can have strong currents and waves. But again, being swept away by a wave in a river might be dangerous. But maybe the wave wasn't that strong? Or maybe the river is not deep enough, so if she was swept under, she might hit the riverbed. But again, not sure.\n\nBathtub. That's a small container. If she was in a bathtub and a wave came, the wave would be very small. But the question says it was a large wave. So maybe the answer isn't the bathtub. Unless the wave is a big wave in a bathtub, but that seems",
