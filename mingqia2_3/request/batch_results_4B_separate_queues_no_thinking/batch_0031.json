        "text": "d0 or something like that. Wait, that's going to be confusing. Maybe I should just use a variable name that's more descriptive. Let me see, the original problem is to solve for x in the equation 2x + 3 = 7. So, the variable is x, and the equation is linear. I need to isolate x. \n\nFirst, I should subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left. So, 2x + 3 - 3 equals 7 - 3. That simplifies to 2x = 4. Then, to solve for x, I divide both sides by 2. So, 2x/2 = 4/2, which gives x = 2. \n\nWait, let me check that again. If I plug x = 2 back into the original equation, 2*(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7, which matches the right side. So that's correct. \n\nBut maybe I should explain each step more clearly. Starting with the equation 2x + 3 = 7. The goal is to solve for x, which means getting x by itself on one side. The first step is to undo the addition of 3. Since addition is the operation here, the inverse operation is subtraction. So, subtract 3 from both sides. \n\n2x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3. Simplify both sides. On the left, 3 - 3 cancels out, leaving 2x. On the right, 7 - 3 is 4. So now the equation is 2x = 4. \n\nNext, I need to get x by itself. The coefficient of x is 2, so I need to divide both sides by 2. \n\n2x / 2 = 4 / 2. Simplify. The 2s on the left cancel out, leaving x. On the right, 4 divided by 2 is 2. So x = 2. \n\nI should verify the solution by substituting it back into the original equation. \n\nLeft side: 2*(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7. Right side is 7. Both sides are equal, so the solution is correct. \n\nHmm, maybe I can also think about this problem in terms of inverse operations. The equation has two operations: multiplication",
