Wait, no, the original integral is [\u222b (x^2 + 3) dx] divided by 3. So first compute the integral of x^2 + 3 from -2 to 2, then divide by 3.\n\nLet me compute the integral:\n\n\u222b_{-2}^2 (x^2 + 3) dx = [ (x^3)/3 + 3x ] from -2 to 2.\n\nCompute at upper limit 2:\n\n(8/3) + 3*2 = 8/3 + 6 = 8/3 + 18/3 = 26/3.\n\nCompute at lower limit -2:\n\n(-8)/3 + 3*(-2) = -8/3 - 6 = -8/3 - 18/3 = -26/3.\n\nSubtracting, upper - lower: 26/3 - (-26/3) = 52/3.\n\nThen divide by 3: (52/3)/3 = 52/9 \u2248 5.777...\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 1. That was a mistake. So where did I go wrong before? I think I confused the integral with something else. So the correct answer is 52/9.\n\nBut let me check again step by step.\n\nFirst, integral of x^2 is x^3/3, integral of 3 is 3x. So the antiderivative is x^3/3 + 3x. Evaluated from -2 to 2.\n\nAt x=2: (8)/3 + 3*2 = 8/3 + 6 = 8/3 + 18/3 = 26/3.\n\nAt x=-2: (-8)/3 + 3*(-2) = -8/3 - 6 = -8/3 - 18/3 = -26/3.\n\nSo the difference is 26/3 - (-26/3) = 52/3.
