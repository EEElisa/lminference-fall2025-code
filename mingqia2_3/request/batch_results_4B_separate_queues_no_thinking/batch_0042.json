Output the answer in the format of \"The answer is (X)\" at the end.\n\nQuestion: A male neonate, who was born at 36 weeks' gestation 2 hours ago in the labor and delivery unit of the hospital, now shows signs of respiratory difficulty. The mother, an 18-year-old primigravid woman, smoked one pack of cigarettes daily throughout her pregnancy. She received prenatal care during most of the pregnancy. One episode of chlamydial cervicitis was detected during the last trimester and treated with azithromycin. The neonate was born via cesarean delivery due to fetal heart rate decelerations. The amniotic fluid was stained with light particulate meconium. Apgar scores were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The patient is 50 cm (20 in; 50th percentile) long and weighs 3005 g (6 lb 10 oz; 50th percentile); head circumference is 35 cm (14 in; 50th percentile). The infant's vital signs now are temperature 36.6\u00b0C (97.8\u00b0F), pulse 150/min, and respirations 70/min. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Physical examination discloses mild subcostal and intercostal retractions. Chest x-ray shows prominent pulmonary vascular markings and fluid in the intralobar fissures.

The year 2024 is poised to be a turning point, marked by groundbreaking advancements in green technology and a renewed global commitment to sustainability. This era, often referred to as AC 2024, is not just a year but a symbol of humanity's collective effort to heal the planet and secure a sustainable future for generations to come.\n\nThe concept of AC 2024 is rooted in the idea of a new beginning, where environmental innovation becomes the cornerstone of progress. As nations and individuals come together, the focus shifts from mere survival to thriving in harmony with nature. This transition is not without its challenges, but it is also brimming with opportunities for creativity, collaboration, and transformation.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the key developments and innovations that define AC 2024, highlighting how green technology is revolutionizing industries, communities, and everyday life. We will delve into the three pillars of this new era: sustainable energy, green technology, and environmental education. Each of these pillars plays a vital role in shaping the future and ensuring that AC 2024 is remembered as a year of significant environmental progress.\n\nSustainable Energy: Powering the Future\n\nOne of the most transformative aspects of AC 2024 is the rapid advancement in sustainable energy solutions. As the world moves away from fossil fuels, renewable energy sources have become the backbone of global energy systems. Solar, wind, and hydropower are no longer just emerging technologies; they have become mainstream, providing clean, reliable, and scalable energy solutions.\n\nIn 2024, the integration of renewable energy into existing infrastructure has reached new heights. Smart grids, powered by AI and machine learning, are optimizing energy distribution, ensuring that energy is used efficiently and reducing waste. These grids are not only capable of balancing supply and demand but also of integrating various renewable sources, making the transition to a low-carbon economy more seamless.\n\nFurthermore, the development of advanced battery storage technologies has been a game-changer. These innovations have made it possible to store excess energy generated from renewable sources, ensuring a consistent power supply even when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. This has significantly increased the reliability of renewable energy, making it a viable alternative to fossil fuels.\n\nAnother remarkable advancement in sustainable energy is the rise",
