(Repeat for 7 days)\n\nDo not use markdown. Please use the format provided in the example. Ensure that the temperatures are realistic for the location and time of year. Make the precipitation and conditions vary for each day. Make the sunrise and sunset times vary slightly each day. Make the air quality comments vary accordingly. Also, the name of the city is \"Aurora Vale\" and the country is \"Virelia\". Make sure to include the country in the comment section. \n\nMake sure that the temperatures, precipitation, and conditions align with each other. For example, if it's rainy, then precipitation should be above 0% and the conditions should be rainy. Similarly, if it\u2019s cloudy, then precipitation should be low and conditions should be cloudy. Also, ensure that the temperatures are realistic for the time of year. For example, if it's winter, the temperatures should be colder. If it's summer, it should be warmer.\n\nThe city is in the fictional nation of Virelia. The country's location is in the northern hemisphere. Assume that it is in the spring, around the time of the virelian spring festival.\nAnswer:\n\nDay 1:\nHigh: 72\u00b0F\nLow: 60\u00b0F\nPrecipitation: 0%\nConditions: Sunny\nSunrise: 6:15 AM\nSunset: 7:45 PM\nAir Quality: Good\n\nDay 2:\nHigh: 75\u00b0F\nLow: 62\u00b0F\nPrecipitation: 20%\nConditions: Partly Cloudy\nSunrise: 6:13 AM\nSunset: 7:48 PM\nAir Quality: Fair\n\nDay 3:\nHigh: 73\u00b0F\nLow: 61",
