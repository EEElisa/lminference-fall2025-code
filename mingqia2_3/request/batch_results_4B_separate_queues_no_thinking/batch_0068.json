The point-slope form is:\n\n$$\ny - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\n$$\n\nWe can use the initial point $(10, 10)$ as $(x_1, y_1)$. Substituting the values into the formula:\n\n$$\ny - 10 = 2(x - 10)\n$$\n\nExpanding the equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ny - 10 &= 2x - 20 \\\\\ny &= 2x - 20 + 10 \\\\\ny &= 2x - 10\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line that passes through the points $(10, 10)$ and $(12.5, 15)$ is $y = 2x - 10$.\n\nLet me verify this. If $x = 10$, then $y = 2(10) - 10 = 20 - 10 = 10$, which matches the first point. If $x = 12.5$, then $y = 2(12.5) - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15$, which matches the second point. Therefore, the equation is correct.\n\nThe slope of the line",
