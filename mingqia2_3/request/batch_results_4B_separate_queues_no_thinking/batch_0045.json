The MAE of the GIBS model was significantly lower than that of the other two models (P<0.0001). These results indicate that the GIBS model has better performance in predicting the 24-hour PM2.5 concentrations.\n\nThe study also found that the GIBS model was more effective in capturing the temporal patterns of PM2.5 concentrations, especially in the morning and evening rush hours when pollution levels typically peak. This is likely due to the model's ability to incorporate high-resolution temporal data and adjust for the diurnal variations in emissions and meteorological conditions.\n\nAnother important finding was the impact of meteorological factors on PM2.5 concentrations. The GIBS model showed that temperature, humidity, and wind speed were significant predictors of PM2.5 levels. For example, higher temperatures and lower wind speeds were associated with increased PM2.5 concentrations, which aligns with the known effects of these factors on air pollution dispersion.\n\nThe study also compared the performance of the GIBS model with traditional models that rely on fixed emission factors, such as the EMEP model. The results showed that the GIBS model outperformed these traditional models, highlighting the benefits of using a more flexible and data-driven approach.\n\nIn terms of practical implications, the study suggests that the GIBS model can be a valuable tool for air quality management and forecasting. By providing more accurate and timely predictions, the model can help policymakers and urban planners implement effective measures to reduce PM2.5 pollution. For example, during high pollution episodes, the model can alert authorities to take action, such as restricting vehicle traffic or increasing green spaces.\n\nMoreover, the study emphasizes the importance of integrating high-resolution data, such as traffic flow and meteorological conditions, into air quality models. This integration allows for a more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing pollution levels and improves the accuracy of predictions. The use of a hybrid model that combines the strengths of both statistical and physical models is a promising approach for future research and applications.\n\nIn conclusion, the GIBS model demonstrates superior performance in predicting 24-hour PM2.5 concentrations in a Chinese city, particularly in capturing the temporal patterns and the influence of meteorological factors. The study provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the GIBS model in",
