        "text": " an explanation of the solution. That is, in the end, you need to provide the answer and the reasoning for it. The riddle must be in the same language as the solution. The riddle must be in English, the solution must be in English, and the explanation must be in English. \nOkay, I need to create a riddle with four lines. The solution should be a popular fairy tale character or story. Let me think about some well-known characters. Cinderella, Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood, maybe the Three Little Pigs, or perhaps a character from a different story like Hansel and Gretel. \n\nI should make sure the riddle is concise and has a clear answer. Let me brainstorm some ideas. Maybe something with a transformation or a magical element. Cinderella has a glass slipper, which is a key item. But how to phrase that into a riddle? Alternatively, Snow White has the seven dwarfs. Or maybe the character who is a queen, like Snow White or another.\n\nWait, the riddle needs to be four lines. Let me think of a structure. Maybe something like: I have a name that's often told, with a twist in the tale. But that's too vague. Let me think of a character with a unique trait. \n\nWhat about a character who is a princess, but not the main one? Maybe Snow White. Or maybe a character that's not the main one but has a significant role. Alternatively, think of a character with a specific item. For example, the Little Mermaid from \"The Little Mermaid\" has a crown. Wait, but that's not a fairy tale character. Or maybe the Three Musketeers? But that's not a fairy tale. \n\nAlternatively, think of the character who is a magical creature. Maybe the fairy godmother from Cinderella? But the riddle should be about the character, not the object. \n\nWait, the solution needs to be a character or story. Let me think of a riddle that could be answered with \"Snow White.\" For example: I have a pale face, a crown of thorns, and a friend who's a dwarf. But that's more than four lines. \n\nAlternatively, think of a character who is known for a specific action. Maybe the Little Red Riding Hood. She goes into the forest, meets a wolf, etc. Maybe the riddle can be something like: I carry a basket, I go into the woods, but I'm not the",
