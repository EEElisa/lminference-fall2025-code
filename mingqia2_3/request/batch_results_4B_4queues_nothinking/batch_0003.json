First, establish community-led conservation initiatives that involve indigenous peoples in decision-making processes, ensuring their cultural practices and knowledge are respected and integrated into development plans. Second, implement legal frameworks that recognize and protect indigenous land rights, allowing communities to manage their territories sustainably and preserve their heritage. Third, support cultural education and documentation programs that record and transmit traditional knowledge, languages, and practices to future generations. These measures ensure that development efforts align with cultural preservation, fostering both environmental and cultural sustainability. By prioritizing indigenous voices and knowledge, policies can promote equitable growth while protecting the rich cultural heritage of indigenous communities.",
