I\u2019ve known Josh and Sarah for years, and I\u2019ve watched them grow together. From the day they met, it was clear they were meant for each other. Sarah was always the one who made me laugh, and Josh was the steady, reliable guy who knew how to hold a conversation. They\u2019ve shared so many memories\u2014late-night talks, spontaneous road trips, and even that time they tried to bake a cake and ended up with a disaster.
