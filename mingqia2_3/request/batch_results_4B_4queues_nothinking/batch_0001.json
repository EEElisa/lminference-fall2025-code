Schr\u00f6dinger Equation**\n\n- Describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time.\n- Fundamental equation in non-relativistic quantum mechanics.\n- Formulated by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in 1926.\n- For a particle of mass $ m $ and energy $ E $, the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is:\n\n$$\ni\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\hat{H} \\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)\n$$\n\n- Where $ \\hat{H} $ is the Hamiltonian operator, $ \\hbar $ is the reduced Planck's constant, and $ \\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t) $ is the wave function.\n- The time-independent version is used for stationary states:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H} \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = E \\psi(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\n\n---\n\n**2. Dirac Equation**\n\n- A relativistic wave equation derived by Paul Dirac in 1928.\n- Accounts for relativistic effects and incorporates spin.\n- Combines quantum mechanics with special relativity.\n- The Dirac equation is:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\gamma^\\mu (i\\hbar \\partial_\\mu - q A_\\mu) - mc \\right) \\psi = 0\n$$\n\n- Where $ \\gamma^\\mu $ are the gamma matrices, $ A_\\mu $ is the electromagnetic four-potential, $ q $ is the charge, and $ m $ is the mass of the particle.\n- Predicts the existence of antiparticles and describes spin-1/2 particles like electrons.",
